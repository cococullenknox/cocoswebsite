ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Undertaking a PhD incurs many debts and this one is no exception. Firstly, I would like to
express my gratitude to be in the privileged position of having the opportunity to undertake
education in a world where many are considerably less fortunate. To that end, I would like to
extend an enormous thanks to my supervisors Libby Lester, Aysha Fleming and Emily Ogier,
you have been a truly amazing team to work with. The wealth of knowledge I have had at my
fingertips has been a privilege and I am humbled to have had the opportunity to work with
such an insightful and supportive team of researchers.
Thank you to the Centre of Marine Socioecology for ongoing support. It has been an honour
to be a part of such an inspiring group. This research was conducted as part of a larger
Australian Research Council (ARC) funded project â€˜Transnational environmental campaigns in
the Australia-Asia regionâ€™ (DP15010454).
A sincere thank you to the participants in the study who gave me their time and insights.
I would like to express my immense appreciation to my family and friends for always making
me see my worth, always believing in me and always, without fail, giving me gusto when I
most need it.
To my Marine Solutionsfamily who have been my rock for many years now and my life would
absolutely not be the same without you. I am eternally grateful for the life-long connections
and the amount of knowledge I have gained from being a part of such a supportive and
knowledgeable team. In moments of doubt the Marine Solutions team has kept me going.
Finally, my late Nana Patsy for whom I dedicate this thesis to.IV
PREFACE
This thesis was born from my personal interest in how humans use and manage natural
resources and the processes by which society decides how this happens. With a background
in environmental science, I began my journey in understanding how the natural world works.
Having worked as an environmental scientist, I became acutely aware that while I could
contribute to the understanding of environmental processes and impacts, and provide
recommendations based on this, change happens with people, and so I sought opportunities
in the social dimensions of natural resource management. As a researcher and practitioner, I
have enjoyed operating at the nexus of environmental and social science to provide holistic
contributions to understanding and managing complex socio-ecological systems and
interactions.
This journey has raised questions for me around the societal mechanisms and processes for
which we, as a global society, negotiate what we are willing to accept. There are many roles
that one can play in these negotiations and learning about where one fits is important. While
I identify as pro-environment and I am ardent about protecting the environment for its
intrinsic value, my interest most strongly lies in the generation of possible solutions, or being
involved in conversations with this end goal in mind, rather than direct action or protest. Here
I see myself assisting the bottom-up movement by facilitating (what I have grown to consider)
useful and productive top-down action to meet somewhere in the middle, where a range of
knowledge, interest and information is understood and transparently negotiated.
Nonetheless, during my time as PhD candidate I did need to acknowledge my biases that
were, in the beginning, potentially more likely to favour environmental outcomes and needed V
to manage these throughout my research. I feel comfortable that my ability to be reflexive
and understand the problem from multiple perspectives has been shaped by working for
environmental consultancies, research organisations and NGOs whereby I have been required
(and lucky enough) to have engaged numerous sectors, clients and operating environments.
This has facilitated and strengthened my desire and ability to approach any given problem
from a range of stakeholder perspectives and understand the role that shared knowledge
plays in problem identification and solution and working through contentious issues. This has
also afforded me the ability to put aside my personal opinions in my professional life.
Nonetheless, I did take actions while doing this research to remain as separate as I could from
public debates. For example, while monitoring conversation on social media I did not engage
in discussion of any kind and refrained from giving personal opinions in discussions with
friends and family. I look forward to continuing my endeavour of facilitating negotiations
regarding natural resource management and am forever open to expanding my knowledge
and to change. VI

ABSTRACT
As human pressure on the environment and natural world increases (Geldmann et al., 2014,
Jones et al., 2018), conflicts over resources and landscapes have become a part of
contemporary political life. Public debate, societal conflict and polarisation occur over the use
of common pool natural resources (Colvin et al., 2015, Lucas and Warman, 2018). Some of
the greatest contestation over natural resource use focuses on the coastal zone, where a
range of interests often diverge regarding use and preservation of resources (Le Heron,
2019). Global environmental change amplifies the complexity of these contestations, with
causes and effects transcending local to global scales (Cash, 2006).
The overarching aim of the thesis is to investigate and critically analyse how environmental
risks are publicly constructed and debated locally and transnationally through processes of
media and communications. It considers how environmental conflict is mediatised (Hutchins
and Lester, 2015: 337) â€“ that is, where media play a constitutive role in the enactment and
experience of these conflicts and political outcomes â€“ and the chain of actions and
interactions that can result. This research places environmental risk negotiations at the nexus
of science information, community interests, industry expansion and impacts and
government decision-making within a critical assessment of media roles, politics and power.
It gives active consideration to how discourses work to shape reality and different agendas.
The thesis builds upon the overall understanding of the mediatisation of environmental
conflict, the politicisation of knowledge and information and the flow of environmental
governance and risk discourses at different temporal and spatial scales.XIX
The research utilises the case of seafood, specifically Atlantic salmon aquaculture in
Tasmania, Australiaâ€™s southern island state. The case study offered the opportunity to
investigate environmental conflict in a context of evident competing politics of the
environment, and to further explore the cross-scale dimensions of how these conflicts
interact at local, transnational, and international scales. The Tasmanian mediatised conflicts
provided the local context for which the research expands to understand transnational flows
of environmental risk, with particular attention to major Asian export markets and salmon
production in Norway. This identifies narratives that transcend political borders and physical
geography and those that differ between local sites of production. In doing so, it explores
how mediatised environmental conflicts are placed and manifest within a global community
of concern.
Because the research aims to examine how environmental risks are constructed publicly at
the discursive level, it draws on media analysis, expert interviews, direct observation and peer
reviewed literature review. This providesinsight into the complex and multi-directional nexus
between media, public and policy across time and scale. The thesis expands both empirical
and theoretical understanding of how environmental risk is negotiated within local and
international communities and across political and cultural borders. Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction

THESIS INTRODUCTIONChapter 1 | Thesis introduction

1.1 How are we negotiating acceptable environmental risk of natural
resource use publicly? and what are the consequences?
As we find ourselves in the Anthropocene, an unprecedented period of human impact on the
natural environment, we (as the human species) are beginning to experience the realities of
the â€œplanetary boundariesâ€ (i.e. fisheries collapse, climate change, species loss, degradation
of physical environments) (Steffen et al., 2015). Therefore, how we as a global society
negotiate environmental risks of natural resource use is increasingly important to meet
requirements for the human population. Environmental movements that promote protection
of the natural values of ecological goods and services (e.g. food, water, fuel and building
materials) are prominent in the discussion about sustainable resource use (Jacquet and Pauly,
2007). The values held by these environmental movements are made visible and carried
through media and are portrayed through environmental campaigns, protest and lobbying.
Media â€“ as a means of communication reaching publics via mechanisms such as internet,
television, radio and newspapers â€“ is a common vehicle in raising awareness and discussion
about natural resources. The interaction between different forms of media, referred to as
â€˜media ecologyâ€™, identifies the shift where once it may have been appropriate to refer to â€˜the
mediaâ€™ â€“ â€œa bounded entity in which media companies hired journalists, editors and camera
operators to produce information in the form of news and entertainment what was circulated
via newspapers and broadcast outlets to readers and viewersâ€ (Lester and Foxwell-Norton,
2020). However, Lester and Foxwell-Norton explains that the use of â€˜theâ€™ before â€˜mediaâ€™ is
now as erroneous as using â€˜theâ€™ before â€˜natureâ€™. This paints the picture that media are
entwined in everyday lives, political decisions, how we negotiate shared challenges and how
the world is understood. Media are no longer able to be neatly separated from society (Deuze, Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
3
2012). Mediatised communications â€“ in which media play more than a neutral role in politics
and societal debates â€“ and public debates over environmental risk are often prompted by
events, activities, decisions and/or developments (Tiller et al., 2012). Once claims and
statements enter contemporary media and communications networks, what Thompson
(2011a: 61) calls the â€œdestabilized spaceâ€, they produce meaning and provoke counter
responses.
How risks are socially constructed is determined by how they are communicated in the public
sphere (Cottle, 1998). The public sphere encompasses the â€œconstellation of communicative
spaces in society that permit the circulation of information, ideas, debates â€“ ideally in an
unfettered manner â€“ and also the formation of political will (i.e. public opinion)â€ (Dahlgren,
2005: 148). Media are core to the enactment of the contemporary public sphere.
Contestation over these risk definitions are the result of competing information and
knowledge, values and interests (Maeseele, 2015a, Hansen and Cox, 2015). To explore the
public interaction of these competing claims, the thesis leans on the notion of â€˜mediatised
environmental conflictâ€™ as theorised by Hutchins and Lester (2015: 337), which in turn builds
on Cottleâ€™s â€˜mediatised conflictâ€™. â€˜Mediatised environmental conflictâ€™ acknowledges the
â€œpolitical significance of the environment, and the pivotal role of media in contests over the
definition and understanding of environmental risks and impactsâ€ (Hutchins and Lester, 2015:
341). These theories depict a political reality which â€œinvolves complex interactions between
(i) activist strategies and campaigns, (ii) journalism practices and news reporting, (iii) formal
politics and decision-making processes, and (iv) industry activities and tradeâ€ (Hutchins and
Lester, 2015: 337). Here, media forms are not only avenues for information dissemination but Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
4
resources for a variety of actors (victims, bystanders, government agencies, commercial
actors, activists and the scientific community) to convey their knowledge, opinions and
interpretations to private and public networks (Cottle, 2006). The information which flows
through these networks enters the political and news discourse of the conflict. Therefore,
theory acknowledges that media are entrenched in the construction of conflict and how the
conflict is conducted. Lester (2016c: 1) argues media provide an â€œarena in which resource
allocation and environmental outcomes are politically negotiated and contestedâ€.
Harnessing conflicting interests and values and utilising different forms of knowledge and
information is fundamental to a deliberative democratic society (Schirmer et al., 2016, Brooks
et al., 2020, Pellizzoni, 2001), most often found in western-style politics. This thesis takes the
macro view of deliberative democracy focusing on the contestation of polarising views and
the associated â€œebb and flow of public debate carried on in media, in private conversations,
in formal and informal settings, from pubs to parliaments and back againâ€ (Parkinson, 2004:
380). How this public debate is enacted through media, and the consequences this has for
social-ecological systems, is central to how sustainable futures are defined and implemented.
This begs the question: how are we publicly negotiating the environmental risks of natural
resource use through media? And what are the consequences?
How complex media and communications processes construct environmental risk discourses
defines what knowledge and interests are considered legitimate. By analysing media
discourses related to environmental governance and industrial expansion, this thesis
investigates how environmental risks are perceived, articulated, responded to and potentially
resolved through complex media and communications processes. It does this by following Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
5
environmental campaigns that seek to influence political, corporate and consumer behaviour
and mediatised public debate. To this end, the thesis approaches environmental risk
governance as a social construct (Hajer, 2009: 10, Hajer and Versteeg, 2005: 175, Dryzek,
2013).
Media constructed discourses of environmental risk governance are the subject for this
research and therefore require a working definition. The term governance (henceforth
including market mechanisms) moves away from the traditional top down regulatory
mechanisms of government, capturing the shift from government to governance whereby
government is simply another player in governing the commercial use of public resources
(Colvin et al., 2015). This is in response to rising prominence of new actors and agents and
complex relationships in natural resource management (Vince and Haward, 2017). Now a
range of actors are engaged in environmental governance including, but not limited to:
consumers and markets, individuals or communities, NGOs, experts and scientists,
transnational corporations, intergovernmental agencies and media. Here I draw on Lemos
and Agrawal (2006:298) to refer to environmental governance as â€œthe set of regulatory
processes, mechanisms and organisations through which political actors influence
environmental actions and outcomesâ€. Thereby, governance captures a greater array of
stakeholders and management mechanisms such as market mechanisms and community
interests alongside state regulation. In this thesis, importance is placed on how those
responsible for knowledge dissemination define the problem and information flows between
stakeholders and across political and cultural boundaries. Particularly, who is getting what
information and why (Beck, 1992, Little et al., 2012).Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction

When considering media in the context of how it is placed within the literature of policy
change there are two lines of thinking: media-as-conduit or media-as-contributor. The
prominent literature on, and scholars in, policy change acknowledge and portray media as
having an important role in political agendas and in the policy change arena (e.g. Sabatier and
Jenkins-Smith, 1993, McCombs and Shaw, 1972, McBeth et al., 2005, Stone, 2012). Notable,
however, is that while media are acknowledged in such literature as a factor, they are often
not addressed as a key actor in policy change (Shanahan et al., 2008). Additionally,
environmental conflicts are increasingly being conducted across political borders via complex
media and communications processes. Environmental campaigning, and its responses, at the
transnational level is likely to continue to become more prominent in world politics as the
international trade of natural resources increases and the environmental risks are shared by
both the locally affected and the global community (Hutchins and Lester, 2015). However,
complexities arise as transnational definitions and negotiations of environmental
sustainability and acceptable environmental risk cross political and cultural borders and local
and global discourses interact (Jacquet and Pauly, 2007). These negotiations occur in a
globally connected society whereby information, capital, trade and personnel flow across
political and cultural borders (Tarrow, 2005, Castells, 2011, Cottle, 2009). Beckâ€™s (1996) â€˜global
risk societyâ€™ and â€˜cosmopolitismâ€™ encompass world-wide communications and global
environmental risks, whereby political borders are transcended boundaries. With this
backdrop, mediatised environmental conflict occurs in a constantly evolving â€˜transnational
public sphereâ€™ (Fraser, 2007).Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
7
While scholarship presents evidence of the mediatisation process, some researchers are
cautious of the term â€˜mediatisationâ€™ because it places too much weight on the influence that
media have on political and corporate decision-making (Deacon and Stanyer, 2014, Hepp et
al., 2015). This view argues that by emphasising media roles one reduces the holistic reality
whereby multiple and wide-ranging elements sway how an issue unfolds. In contrast, Kriesi
(2013: 155) explain â€œmedia and mediated communication are of central relevance for
contemporary societies due to their decisive influence on, and consequences for, political
institutions, political actors and individual citizensâ€. While media are only one component of
the governance framework, they have â€œa crucial responsibility as a source of information and
opinionsâ€ (Carvalho, 2007: 223) and are a significant influencer in how environmental
decisions are made and communicated.
To explore these theoretical tensions and contribute to theory globally, in Chapter 2, I utilise
the case of seafood, specifically Atlantic salmon aquaculture in Tasmania, Australiaâ€™s southern
island state. This case provides the local context for which the research expands to
understand transnational flows of environmental risk, with particular attention to major Asian
export markets, especially China, and the largest and oldest salmon producing country,
Norway. The Tasmanian industry (consisting of three main companies) emerged from a
collaboration between the State Government and Norwegian company in the 1980s. During
the time of this research the industry was experiencing considerable growth, relying on access
to the publicly owned waterways which was accompanied by publicised societal debate.
While the industry has provided regional towns with reliable economic stimulus, controversy
over the environmental impact of and use of public waterways was gaining considerable Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
8
momentum, entrenched in a rich history of environmental conflict in Tasmania. These
conflicts remained locally contained until 2017 and the airing of â€˜Big Fishâ€™ on Four Corners, the
flagship investigative journalism program of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC),
Australiaâ€™s publicly funded national broadcaster. Tensions were exacerbated by changing
international trade conditions within free trade agreements negotiated with China in 2015,
Tasmaniaâ€™s largest export market for farmed Atlantic salmon (along with other seafood
products) (FRDC, 2018, Fabinyi, 2007).
In the context of intensifying pressure for resource access, market opportunities and evolving
media practices, it has become critical to examine how competing environmental claims are
mediatised, and how this mediatisation influences public debate and governance of natural
resources. Providing evidence-based analysis of local and transnational conflicts as they
emerge and travel and how they interact, this thesis will inform understanding of how
Australiaâ€™s seafood sustainability is constructed and the role of media. By bringing together
the literature on environmental governance and mediatisation in the context of Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture, and seafood more broadly, it is evident that conceptualisation of the
dynamics and dimensions of environmental conflict and governance would benefit from
considering mediatisation and its transnational dimensions.
1.2 Objectives and Research Questions
This thesis makes a novel contribution to critically examine how and by whom environmental
risks are perceived in a context of increasing pressure and conflict over natural resources.
Specifically, it investigates media constructions of environmental risks and how these flow
locally and transnationally with regard to regions of trade and production. The interaction Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
9
between claims and counter-claims is explored with attention given to legitimacy (Fraser,
2007) and power (Affolderbach, 2011), in the context of environmental communication and
governance in a transnational world. These aims are realised through the following four
research questions (RQ), which are used to synthesise the approach and findings of the
research:
RQ1) What are the dominant claims and counter-claims being mediated in relation to
environmental risk?
Because media constructs what counts as an environmental risk, the first task is to see what
is being presented by media, how it is framed, and the consequences of this, looking at the
case of salmon aquaculture. This question is predominantly explored in Chapter 5 and further
developed in Chapters 6 and 7.
RQ2) How and by whom are environmental risks being negotiated publicly?
Building on ideas of legitimacy and power, this question acts to uncover what stakeholders
are present and absent in environmental conflicts and how they interact. It examines how
environmental activism seeks to change political, corporate and consumer behaviour and
how industry and government attempt to manage the risks of environmental campaigns.
Importantly, it exposes how interests, knowledge and evidence is contested within debates
of environmental sustainability and risk. Again, this question is predominantly explored in
Chapter 5 and further developed in Chapters 6 and 7.Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
10
RQ3) How do local mediatised environmental conflicts and transnational discourses of
environmental sustainability interact?
Once the discourses of environmental risks are understood in a local context, mediatised
environmental conflicts are then placed within transnational discourses of environmental
sustainability. This research question examines how debates of environmental sustainability
and risk are constructed in different world regions, highlighting trends in environmental risk
conflicts across spheres of influence and scales. Specifically, this question seeks to understand
how environmental sustainability is negotiated within an international community and across
political and cultural borders. It uncovers how institutional design of production at local sites
interact with transnational discourses and vice versa. This question is answered in Chapters
6 and 7.
RQ4) What are the roles of media and what are the processes of mediatisation in
communicative governance in cases of environmental risk?
This question allows the thesis to empirically link environmental conflicts with governance
processes and communication strategies to understand the capacity of mediatised public
debate to identify opportunities to support sound and just collective environmental
governance and decision-making. It considers how associated media practices and logics
might influence outcomes of complex common pool natural resource-use conflicts. By doing
so it probes the theorised struggle between media-as-conduit or media-as-contributor to
policy change. It seeks to uncover the implications for the governance of environmental risk
in the context of common pool natural resource use. While this question is answered across
all results chapters it is the key guiding question for the discussion in Chapter 8.Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
11
1.3 Scope of thesis
The aim of the thesis and the subsequent research questions are empirically investigated
through three results chapters (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) which all focus on different spatial scales
â€“ local, transnational and international respectively â€“ using the case of Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture and seafood more broadly. The contribution of looking at mediatisation across
these scales is highly novel but also highly specific and therefore cannot represent all
environmental risks and issues occurring.
The geographical focus of this thesis spans three levels (see further elaborations in sections
3, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.4.1):
1) The environmental risk discourses regarding salmon farming in Tasmania, Australia and
how they are placed within media communications, causing regionally contained tensions
and contested claims,
2) How these local claims and counter-claims interact and flow transnationally with respect
to market mechanisms â€“ this focus being on the Australia-Asia region, specifically China.
This explores if and how local and transnational environmental discourses interact, and
3) Lastly, the thesis draws on the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry â€“ exposed to the
same global demands and trade conditions as Tasmania. This aims to understand how
mediatised environmental debates over the production of Atlantic salmon are presented
and enacted in both Australia and Norway. This identifies narratives that transcend
political borders and physical geography and those that differ between local sites of Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
12
production. In doing so it explores how environmental conflicts are placed and manifest
within a global community of concern. The findings from Tasmania are tested against the
trajectory and lessons from Norway (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Three spheres at which environmental risk are negotiated. Local tensions of Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture interact within a global community of concern and markets. International supply chains partly sit
within transnational flows of information and local tensions feed into markets and supply chains.
The scope of this research includes news coverage of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry between 2015 and 2017. During this time, two key events occurred in the case
timeline â€“ the Senate Inquiry into the regulation of the fin-fish aquaculture industry and the
Four Corners episode â€˜Big Fishâ€™ â€“ which are outlined in Section 2.5 and guided the collection
of news media. The scope excludes the 2019 Tasmanian Legislative Council lead Inquiry into
fin-fish farming in Tasmania (Dennien, 2019).

It is beyond the scope of the thesis to complete a comparative dataset of news coverage of
the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry (limited by access and language ability). Instead,
a systematic review of academic peer reviewed literature was conducted to collate and
synthesise literature which documented media analysis of social conflict regarding
environmental risks of salmon aquaculture in Norway.
For this analysis of environmental risk discourses in media, I apply the lens of â€˜mediatisationâ€™,
particularly â€˜mediatised environmental conflictâ€™, whereby environmental disputes are
approached as interactions between various actors and how these interactions come
together to change the course of the discourses and outcomes of the conflict (Hutchins and
Lester, 2015). This follows Carvalho's (2007: 226) approach to examining news media, which
focuses on â€œchallenges to discourse constructions of the issueâ€. It allows for organisation of
data that captures, to the greatest degree possible, the various actors and arguments that are
present in the discourse. The thesis addresses the construction of environmental risk
discourses and flows of claims and counter-claims in environmental conflicts across time and
scale, rather than the physical environmental risks. The research is placed to contribute to
understanding media roles in framing environmental debates as having important
consequences for policy and resource management, how it influences the operating
environment for claims-makers and decision-makers in environmental governance and how
different stakeholders engage as political actors. Here I draw on Leith et al.â€™s (2014a: 163)
description of the â€˜operating the environmentâ€™ as the â€œdynamic and cumulative interactions
between actors, values, stakes, and the institutions, processes, discourses and objects that
mediate such interactionsâ€.Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
14
Underpinning this work is the intention to make visible communication strategies and
mechanisms that inflate environmental conflicts. Through this, the thesis aims to make
explicit the underlying reasons for conflict in media and even reflect on a new paradigm for
claims-making, counter-claims making, the communication of decision-making processes,
interests and values, and how different information and knowledge is communicated and
considered in the negotiations of acceptable environmental risk. It proposes practical
considerations for a range of stakeholder groups and contributes to media and
communications theory in hope of enhancing further research into public conflicts of
environmental risk. It does this in the context of increasingly complex and expanding
networks of communications, commerce and environmental governance.

N/A
The results chapter presents a discussion
of how environmental sustainability
concepts are developed within an
international community. It focuses on
how these are articulated in ecolabeling
standards and interact with local
mediatised environmental debates.
Likewise, how local issues influence
international discourse regarding the
environmental sustainability seafood is
explored.
3) This results chapter contributes an
understanding of the narratives that
transcend political borders and differ
between growing regions. It also compares
narratives of two countries across time and
how transnational flows of information
contribute to how similar or different their
trajectories are.
RQ4)
What are the
roles of media
and what are the
processes of
mediatisation in
communicative
governance in
cases of
environmental
risk?
This results chapter explores how
mediated environmental debate
influences the operating
environment for claims-makers and
decision-makers in environmental
governance and how different
stakeholders engage as political
actors.
The chapter explores under what
circumstances and to what extent
deliberation concerning
environmental risks associated with
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture is
conducted virtuously or viciously in
the public sphere.
In the results chapter the importance of
addressing both local and global factors
in communication and governance
strategies are identified. This includes
some of the implications when local and
global contexts of mediated
environmental conflicts are not
considered in communications of key
stakeholders.
This results chapter presents a synthesis of
the lessons from the previous three
chapters, tests it against scholarly accounts
of mediatised conflicts in Norway, and
contributes to the theory of mediatised
environmental conflict. It explores how
two salmon aquaculture industries have
evolved over time, why they might have
different local risk discourses and public
spheres and the role of different
institutional designs. Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction

1.4 Statement of significance and contribution
This thesis draws primarily upon the research fields of environmental communication and
environmental governance by traversing areas of media studies and policy change (Shanahan
et al., 2008, Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1993, McCombs and Shaw, 1972, McBeth et al., 2005,
Stone, 2012, Wolfe et al, 2013, Kenis and Schneider, 1991, Keck and Sikkink, 1998: 95,
Hutchins and Lester, 2015, Habermas, 1991), including across scale (Fraser, 2007: 15, Lester,
2014). A research agenda at the nexus of media, policy and publics across local and
transnational scales is important as the international trade of natural resources increases and
the environmental risks are shared by both the locally affected and the global community.
Environmental campaigning at the transnational level is likely to continue to become more
prominent in world politics (Hutchins and Lester, 2015). Hence, the notion of the â€˜locally
affectedâ€™, â€˜global riskâ€™ and â€˜distant awareâ€™ (Lester, 2014) is increasingly relevant. However, as
a research community our understanding is still in its infancy regarding how this plays out in
relation to media roles and environmental campaigning in environmental governance,
particularly how this occurs transnationally. The most difficult part of any issue is arguably the
â€˜switch from a campaigning to a solutions phaseâ€™ (Braun and Judy, 2004: 183).
By addressing these gaps, this thesis contributes to three fields of research: 1) environmental
conflict and media, 2) transnational public spheres and 3) environmental governance of
seafood and natural resources more broadly. It builds on the current literature on media roles
in environmental conflicts and transnational negotiations of environmentally sustainable use
of natural resources by placing these discussions within the context of â€˜socio-ecological
systemsâ€™ (Ostrom, 2009). While there have been invaluable studies into mediaâ€™s role in Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
18
framing aquaculture, particularly salmon, in the U.S. (Amberg and Hall, 2008), Germany
(Feucht and Zander, 2017), and Norway (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017), this thesis conducts
the only known media analysis dedicated to the Australian salmon aquaculture debates. Since
conducting the research for this thesis Haas et al. (2020) has also produced valuable research
exploring how seafood certification is represented in Australian media, featuring the ASC
certification of the Tasmanian salmon industry.
The main conceptual contribution is the expansion of the theory of mediatised environmental
conflict by considering the role of scientists and science information in mediatised
environmental conflicts (Hutchins and Lester, 2015), discussed in Chapter 8 (Synthesis and
discussion). In the context of salmon aquaculture, scientists are those that conduct research,
development and/or monitoring of fish health and growth and environmental impacts and
conditions of producing salmon for food.
The thesis contributes to understanding the interpretation and communication of
environmental sustainability through international seafood supply chains and to audiences at
different spatial scales. By traversing local and global scales, this research contributes to
understanding the mechanisms for which information regarding the mediatisation of
environmental risk flows locally and transnationally. In doing so it also identifies some of the
risks of not addressing both local and global factors in communication and governance
strategies and the implications for local discourse, market access, and governance. Chapter 1 | Thesis introduction
19
1.5 Thesis structure
Chapter 1 presents the research objectives and questions, rationale, and scope of the thesis.
Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing knowledge and theory in environmental
communications and environmental governance including transnational environmental
conflicts. This chapter also describes some background of global fisheries and aquaculture.
Chapter 3 introduces the case of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania, Australia. These chapters
place the thesis in the existing knowledge and theoretical contexts and explicate its relevance
and importance. Chapter 4 explains the research approach and methodology including
research assumptions, application of qualitative methods and description of data collection,
generation and analysis. It also offers reflection on the research limitations and addresses
measures for assessing quality. Following this, the findings of the research are presented in
Chapters 5, 6 and 7. Chapters 5 and 6 develop ideas presented in three journal manuscripts
published in peer reviewed academic journals (see appendices for copies of the publications).
Chapter 5 analyses the news media representations of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry to understand how and by whom are the environmental risks placed in the discourse.
Chapter 6 uncovers how local environmental risk discourses interact with transnational
environmental sustainability debates and governance mechanisms. This chapter focuses on
the Australia-Asia region. Chapter 7 compares how environmental risks of salmon aquaculture
are framed in Australian and Norwegian news media. This examines how risk discourses
traverse different scales of physical geography and public spheres.
Chapter 8 synthesises the research findings across the results chapters by relating back to the
thesis aims and research questions. This chapter considers the implications of the mediatedChapter 1 | Thesis introduction
20
claims and counter-claims across scale, media roles in environmental conflict and contributes
to the theory of mediatised environmental conflict by extending it to include science and
science communication. The thesis contribution to society more broadly is considered along
with and future research recommendations. To conclude, Chapter 9 offers an overall
reflection on the thesis.Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts

2.1 Introduction
This chapter summarises the existing literature that explores the nexus between media,
publics and policy in environmental governance both locally and transnationally. It pays
particular attention to seafood and aquaculture â€“ the case used in this thesis to address the
research questions. This field of research is critical in a future of mounting pressure on
resources and an increasingly transnational approach to their production/extraction, use and
governance. These issues and their related environmental communications theories have not
been explored extensively at the case level, to understand empirical examples, nor in seafood
sectors specifically. The rationale for selecting seafood as a sector and aquaculture as a case
within this sector to explore these issues and theories is then described in detail in Chapter 2.
Environmental issues are increasingly global in terms of not only some issues themselves
(climate change) but also the ways in which goods, services, resources, people, and
information move and flow. Media are key to how environmental messages flow across scale
and have undergone considerable changes in how messages are communicated. Digital
communications are having an increasing role and influence on the conditions under which
shared futures are negotiated. The rise of the internet in the 1990s facilitated intense global
debates initiated by pursuits for environmentally sustainable development (DÃ­az-Pont et al.,
2020). ENGOs are active in this transnational trend, using media to share information and
exert influence in widening public and political spheres. Responding to environmental
campaigns is important for governments and industries to remain legitimate (Emtairah and
Mont, 2008, Morrison, 2014).Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts

What knowledge and information are shared and by whom influences how socio-ecological
issues are framed in public debates. Following these information flows can illuminate areas of
governance processes and private and public activities that cause societal tensions. Politics
and media are increasingly intertwined (Juric et al., 2013) and there is still a lack of consensus
around the implications of this relationship. Wolfe et al (2013) acknowledge the lack of
knowledge sharing and integration of media functionality and policy agendas. He identifies
the resultant gap in understanding how policy agendas and international markets are shaped
by media, how publics participates in transnational governance, how information is being
shared transnationally and what this means for decision-making in an increasingly
transnational world.
2.2 Environmental governance and environmental conflict
Accompanying the increased pressure on natural resources to sustain the human population
is the awareness of the notion of â€˜sustainable developmentâ€™. Sustainable development
encompasses the concept that human life is sustained within the limits of earthâ€™s carrying
capacity so that future generations are unimpacted (IUCN, 1980). Sustainable development
was first defined at the 1992 Earth Summit (Agenda 21), where it was agreed that the
integration of social, economic and environmental factors is required to ensure inter
generational equity. Conceptually, sustainable development has continued to receive
international priority. Agenda 21 also identifies the necessity to â€œreverse the tendency to treat
the environment as a â€œfree goodâ€ and to pass these [environmental] costs on to other parts
of society, other countries, or to future generationsâ€ (United Nations Division for Sustainable
Development, 1992). The environmental sustainability construct is both widely used and Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
24
widely disputed (Seghezzo, 2009). Environmental sustainability can be approached from
either the perspective of how best to protect environmental attributes or how to use an
environmental resource most optimally. Also variously interpreted is how these perspectives
fit with the construct of sustainable development. As the definition of â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ is
constantly evolving, so is the debate concerning the governance processes that promote
sustainable outcomes (Cash et al., 2003).
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) discusses the benefits
and challenges of the globalisation of markets for seafood as a sustainable resource stating
that management frameworks must â€œaccommodate globalisation without undermining
resource sustainabilityâ€ (OECD, 2010: 18). The OECD explains globalisation â€œas a process
towards closer economic integration of marketsâ€ and that â€œthere are no compelling
reasonsâ€¦to suggest that, spurred by new information and communication technologies as
well as by business strategies and public policies, the process will not continue to evolveâ€
(OECD, 2010: 18). Although globalisation has empowered corporatisation, corporations have
also been restricted by environmental limits and environmental movements creating
considerable tensions at this interface. This growing tension between globalisation and
environmental sustainability suggests that debate regarding how we use our natural resources
will continue to be a prominent component of global politics, making both transnational and
local flows of information and people a cornerstone area of research as we move forward in
an increasingly transnational world.
The traditional top down regulatory approach to marine resource management has been
challenged by the rising prominence of new actors and complex relationships in the past few Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
25
decades, creating various forms of hybrid or network governance regimes (Vince and Haward,
2017). These network style approaches to governance allow great adaptability to different,
and often competing, attitudes, values and beliefs that are highlighted in the public sphere.
The developments in information and communication technologies have given societal actors
a more prominent role in environmental governance by providing a communication pathway
for greater reach of information and interaction with other publics, interest groups and
corporate targets (Cullen-Knox et al., 2017a, Lester, 2016b, Wallis and Given, 2016). Capturing
this evolving power of community and ENGOs, the concept of â€˜social licence to operateâ€™ is
having increasing sway in environmental governance (Kelly et al., 2017, Cullen-Knox et al.,
2017b, Edwards et al., 2019).
To explain why industry or government respond to ENGO activity and negative media
coverage, some scholars apply legitimacy theory (e.g. Emtairah and Mont, 2008, Morrison,
2014). The legitimacy of an organisation or group is largely built around perception whereby
â€œthe actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed
systems of norms, values, beliefs and definitionsâ€ (Suchman, 1995: 574). Usually, this refers
to the perception of relevant publics and society, as they are usually either the consumers or
voters. Losing legitimacy, or a social licence to operate, makes an organisation more
vulnerable to its surrounding environment.
King (2008: 395), uses the loss of organisational legitimacy as an explanation for how social
movement activists, â€œa relatively powerless group of individualsâ€ are able to shape the
decision-making of the elite and â€œmore powerful counterpartsâ€ and activate internal change.
Research conducted by Arenas et al. (2009) suggests that the role ENGOs play in society is Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
26
perceived as influencers of corporate social responsibility and notes the conviction with which
they do this. Deegan and Islam (2014) investigate NGO and media influence in global supply
chains by applying the notion (also supported by Ader, 1995) that changes in corporate
practices are a result of changes in community expectations. Therefore, the extent and the
nature of media activity, by influencing these expectations, will determine corporate
practices. Deegan (2014) applies this approach to media agenda setting theory along with
legitimacy theory to conclude that NGOs rely on news media to help create a â€˜legitimacy gapâ€™
or â€˜legitimacy crisisâ€™ for an organisation for which the said organisation responds in attempt
to regain support, and subsequently NGOs achieve their desired outcomes.
If we explore the literature specifically looking at the role of environmental campaigning in
natural resource governance there are generally two lines of thought. These present
environmental campaigning as; 1) the barrier to collaboration and productive conversation;
or 2) an indicator for internal barriers to collaboration, management failure and/or poor
communication of the management process. For example, van Huijstee and Glasbergen (2010)
research identifies that once environmental campaigns utilise a symbolic damage strategy, a
constructive setting is difficult to achieve. Arenas et al. (2009) highlight the difficulties in
building shared understanding between ENGOs and their corporate targets. Alternatively,
King (2008) argues that â€˜extra-institutional tacticsâ€™ (e.g. protest) as a means to exert influence
are often used when â€˜legitimate channelsâ€™ (legal or collaboration) are blocked. By this
understanding, extra-institutional tactics could be an indicator of internal blockages for more
legitimate or collaborative approaches. Leadbitter and Benguerel (2014) suggest that
environmental campaigning could be an indication of the failure of management regimes, Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
27
which lack a holistic approach to managing the use of, and impact on, marine resources.
Alternatively, it could also indicate poor communication of the trade-offs and benefits of
management decisions in a way that could help promote informed and accountable
discussions. This captures the shift from government to governance whereby government is
simply another player in managing the commercial use of public resources (Colvin et al., 2015).
Now a range of actors are engaged in environmental governance including, but not limited to:
consumers and markets, affected individuals or communities, ENGOs, experts and scientists,
transnational corporations, intergovernmental agencies and media. This signposts the role for
public participation and involvement of a wider network in complex new processes of
governance (for more detail see section 2.3.1).
Theories such as â€˜mediatised environmental conflictâ€™ (Hutchins and Lester, 2015), â€˜bargaining
powerâ€™ (Affolderbach, 2011), â€˜legitimacyâ€™ (Fraser, 2007) and â€˜switching pointsâ€™ (Castells, 2004)
highlight the interaction of multiple interest groups involved in environmental conflicts and
how these interactions play out in the public sphere via media and communications processes.
Power exchange between actors or groups often occurs around â€˜critical discourse momentsâ€™
(Carvalho, 2005) where key events in the conflict timeline can change the course of the conflict
or reaffirm the existing trajectory of the discourse. With regard to how public problems
materialise, authority â€œshould alwaysâ€ be realised in the communications of such problems,
hence the importance of developing â€œan understanding of the mechanisms that are at play in
the mediatised world of governanceâ€ (Hajer, 2009: 10). In an age of â€˜mediatised politicsâ€™
(Meyer and Hinchman, 2002) defining authority and who has that authority is challenging,
particularly in complex issues of sustainability or resource use and even more so when these Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
28
issues transcend international markets. Another key challenge is the scale and cross-scale
dynamics of global environmental change whereby the causes and effects transcend local to
global scales (the most common human-environment interactions being temporal, spatial and
jurisdictional) (Cash, 2006). In an effort to address this multi-scale socio-ecological system,
market-based mechanisms have been developed to create global benchmarks for
environmental standards (Eden and Bear, 2010).
When debates centre around issues concerning complex socio-ecological systems (Ostrom,
2009), there is potential for disagreement between different sources of knowledge and
information and what constitutes evidence. Public communications of fisheries and marine
aquaculture environmental governance, as a focal case of this thesis, is a combination of
information and persuasion, which is constantly underpinned by scientific uncertainty. There
is growing evidence in the marine sector that a middle ground between public attitudes,
environmental campaigning and marine science is proving difficult to achieve (Mazur et al.,
2014). As Beck (1992) explains, although as a global society we are generating greater
knowledge, consensus appears to be less and less attainable.
In considering this contestation of knowledge and public conflict as productive or
unproductive in terms of environmental governance, Martin (2005) defines unproductive
conflict as â€œresource use competition accompanied by governance failureâ€¦where conflict
leads to non-corporative outcomesâ€. The author is acknowledging a gap that exists in
understanding the communications circumstances under which unproductive conflict is
fostered. However, this raises questions of what constitutes productive and unproductive
conflict and for whom? While social conflict plays an important role in encouraging Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
29
corporations and governments to act in the public interest and adjusting power distribution,
making sure both claims-making and decision-making are not reactive can help ensure conflict
is productive.
Identifying and assessing environmental â€˜risksâ€™ (including acceptable level of risk) occurs at the
nexus of the legal system, scientific knowledge and media. This interaction was coined
â€˜relations of definitionâ€™ (Beck, 1992). Similarly, the risk conflicts perspective (see Maeseele,
2015a: 280, Hansen and Cox, 2015) embodies â€œcontestation between various social actors
over competing risk definitions, which are based on the confluence of competing: (a) scientific
rationality claims; (b) values; and (c) interestsâ€. Therefore, how risks are socially constructed
is determined by how they are communicated in the public sphere (Cottle, 1998). Little et al.
(2012) applies â€˜relations of definitionâ€™ identifying how those responsible for knowledge
dissemination define the problem, exploring information flows regarding who is getting what
information and why. Importantly this acknowledges the risks of publicly contesting
knowledge and the difficulties this creates for identifying the â€˜truthâ€™ in a mediatised problem.
2.2.1 Science in environmental governance and conflict
Traditionally, the role of science is to advise government decision-making (Scheufele, 2014) â€“
what Habermas (1970) called â€˜scientisationâ€™ â€“ whereby citizens have little influence and
technical experts and bureaucracy control government. Here, those who hold â€˜expert
knowledgeâ€™ are empowered while lay people are marginalised. Industry also undertakes its
own research â€“ referred to as the â€œscience-industrial complexâ€ which â€œenjoys the benefits of
largely promotional institutional science communication channels to foreclose any debate
over the problem of known and unknown risksâ€ (Maeseele, 2009: 70). Activists attempt to Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
30
counter this by generating their own research â€“ referred to as â€œdemocratising science
movementsâ€¦the process through which lay understandings are taken into account when
scientific knowledge production is used to make political decisionsâ€ (McCormick, 2007: 610).
With media and wider society influencing the governability of environmental challenges,
problem definitions become a construct of social interactions, moving away from a pure
scientific understanding (Osmundsen et al., 2017, Bocking, 2012, Maeseele, 2009). Social
movements are seen to rise into the role of â€œalternative science communicatorsâ€ (Maeseele,
2009).
The involvement of scientists in controversial debates â€“ as actors or as sources of information
remote from the public sphere â€“ is still up for debate. If scientists are actors in public debate,
they require the necessary communication skills or expertise to usefully contribute,
particularly if the issue is political or controversial (Besley and Tanner, 2011). While training
in the communication of science is becoming increasingly common, scientists can be hesitant
to participate because of the inherent risk of getting involved in controversial and political
issues (Dunwoody, 2015). While some scientists see themselves as separate from the public
sphere, â€œa messy space of negotiation and contest that has a clearly troubled relationship with
factâ€ (Lester, 2019). In the case of climate change we can see that the authority of science
can be publicly challenged (Sarewitz, 2004), potentially making it even less appealing for
scientists to engage publicly in controversial debate.
The expectation that science is considered â€œrelevant, legitimate and accountableâ€¦ illustrate
the essential dilemma of science advisors: to serve as a constructive and trusted partner to
policy makers, while maintaining professional independenceâ€ (Bocking, 2013: 154). Science Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
31
and scientific advice become inherently politicised if the research problems being explored
are used to advise policy and the boundaries between science and society becomes blurred.
I draw on this definition of politicisation and its twin, depoliticisation:
a discursive logic that frames an issue as involving key political choices between alternative
(sustainable) futures, by revealing competing sets of claims, values and/or interests
underlying opposing demands. Depoliticization is defined as a discursive logic which frames
an issue in terms of a social consensus about an inevitable, natural development best left to
technocratic or market considerations. (Maeseele 2017:169)
The nexus between science and publics is commonly mediated via news, entertainment and
social media, across broadcast, print and the internet. As media increasingly make available
science information, the nexus between science, public and media is becoming more
prevalent. However, the relationship between science and media is described as
â€œtumultuousâ€ (Besley and Tanner, 2011: 241). This is particularly due to the misinterpretation
and misinformation of science information in media, often due to the difficulty of
communicating complex science information according to journalistic norms. Increasingly,
journalists need to have a scientific understanding, and scientists in turn need to understand
journalistic processes. There has been a call amongst scientists to curb misrepresentation by
improving their capability and capacity to contribute to policy debates through direct public
engagement and media (Besley and Tanner, 2011).
The framing of science in environmental controversies in media is determined by a range of
external factors such as competing newsworthy events, economic and political conditions and Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
32
the perceptions of credibility (Bocking, 2012). It is not only scientific information that is being
mediated but the scientific process:
As researchers have noted, the media do not present merely scientific knowledge, but also
ideas regarding the practice of science (Gregory and Miller, 1998: 90). This reflects not only
curiosity about what scientists do, but concerns regarding science in its social context:
scepticism regarding the relations between science and political or economic interests;
demands for guidance in evaluating the credibility and trustworthiness of science and
scientists, or in understanding the meaning of controversies between scientists; and a lack
of clarity regarding scientific uncertainties such as those encountered in relation to climate
change (Zehr, 2000; Mooney, 2005; Carvalho, 2007; Weingart, 2007; McGarity and Wagner,
2008; Michaels, 2008). One consequence has been the emergence of an image of science
as less a pathway to objective truth, than a social institution akin to that described by
historians and sociologists of science, in which scientific practice and knowledge are shaped
by the diverse values, interests, and ideologies of its practitioners, patrons, and audiences
â€“ in short, a view of knowledge as a contingent phenomenon (Bocking, 2012: 706).
Carvalho (2007: 237) emphasises the significance of how â€œfactsâ€ and â€œtruth claimsâ€ are
selected and presented in media and who is considered â€œexperts and counter-expertsâ€ or
presented as authorised â€œagents of definition of scientific knowledgeâ€ that are given voice in
political action. Carvalho (2007: 239) argues that the â€œrepresentation of scientific knowledge
has important implications for evaluating political programs and assessing the responsibility
of both governments and the public in addressingâ€ these programs (in this case climate
change).Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
33
2.3 Mediatisation and mediatised environmental conflict
The importance of media in social-ecological systems was highlighted in McGinnis and
Ostromâ€™s (2014) revised version of Ostromâ€™s (2009) original social-ecological systems
framework. Media roles within social networks (social interactions and structures between a
set of actors) of environmental governance and interfaces between ENGOs, local
communities, export markets, government, industry and environmental science and scientists
at local and global scales is evidently multifaceted and multi-directional. The outputs of these
social interactions inevitably (and at times significantly) affect the physical and living
environment (Barnes et al., 2016). Environmental feedbacks are subsequently reacted to and
absorbed by the social system, and so on. To contribute to the understanding of this complex
whole (that is the social-ecological system), specific knowledge regarding each variable must
be obtained and consistently re-evaluated. In such intrinsic systems complexity must be
analysed and harnessed rather than eliminated (Ostrom, 2009).
Hutchins and Lester (2015) acknowledge that common pool environmental resources attract
conflict, which is difficult to solve due to the varying multitude of actors involved and under
global trade conditions (Lester, 2019). â€˜Mediatised environmental conflictâ€™ as theorised by
Hutchins and Lester (2015) captures how power is played out in the public sphere regarding
how we use â€“ and impact â€“ the environment and natural resources. This emphasises problems
such as â€œwho is affected, who is responsible [and] who should respond, and how?â€ (Lester,
2016a: 1). The contemporary â€˜mediatised environmental conflictâ€™ builds on Cottleâ€™s
â€˜mediatised conflictâ€™ and depicts a political reality which â€œinvolves complex interactions
between (i) activist strategies and campaigns, (ii) journalism practices and news reporting, (iii) Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
34
formal politics and decision-making processes, and (iv) industry activities and tradeâ€ (Hutchins
and Lester, 2015: 337). Hutchins and Lester acknowledge the significance of Cottleâ€™s (2006)
â€˜mediatised conflictâ€™ which identifies media forms as not only avenues for information
dissemination but more so as resources for a variety of actors (victims, bystanders,
government agencies, commercial actors, activists and the scientific community) to convey
their knowledge, opinions and interpretations to private and public networks. The information
which flows through these networks enters into the political and news discourse of the
conflict. Therefore, this theory acknowledges that media are entrenched in the construction
of conflict and how the conflict is conducted. Hutchins and Lesterâ€™s theory builds on this by
acknowledging the â€œpolitical significance of the environment, and the pivotal role of media in
contests over the definition and understanding of environmental risks and impactsâ€ (Hutchins
and Lester, 2015: 341). Lester (2016c: 1) argues that media provides an â€œarena in which
resource allocation and environmental outcomes are politically negotiated and contestedâ€.
The â€˜mediatised conflictâ€™ theory, Cottle (2006), identifies media and media practices as much
more than simply the process for which news regarding conflicts is relayed to audiences. In
this sense, â€˜mediaâ€™ take the form, for example, of websites, blogs, social media, YouTube, radio
and television broadcast. These forms of media are available to actors outside of the news
and political spheres with their content flowing into news and political discourses surrounding
the conflict (Hutchins and Lester, 2015). Additionally, media can be thought of as not only
communications pathways (e.g., social media) but as actors (news media). By selecting who
and what is in the public domain, identifying those with interests, who are affected, and the
issues that are visible in online, print and broadcast media forums play a central role in Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
35
determining what is being contested and who participates in the negotiations (Lester, 2016a)
as well as how the issues are framed, constructed and thus, how they are likely to be
interpreted.
Mediatisation captures a large-scale transformation in everyday life, society, culture and
contemporary politics, a process where media have infiltrated into all domains of society
(Krotz, 2017), and one to which decisions over salmon aquaculture are not immune. Likened
to the processes of globalisation, society cannot escape mediatisation where the power and
effects of media shapes and frames communication as well as the society for which
communication occurs. Such social transformations are referred to as â€œmeta-processesâ€
(Lundby, 2009). Mediatisation has become systemic over the last two decades and
mediatisation theory and â€˜media-centeredâ€™ research â€œ involves a holistic understanding of the
various intersecting social forces at work at the same time as we allow ourselves to have a
particular perspective and emphasis on the role of media in these processesâ€ (Hepp et al.,
2015: 316).
2.3.1 The multi-directional role of media and environmental
campaigning in environmental governance
Well-established concepts such as â€˜policy networksâ€™ (Rhodes, 2006) and the â€˜advocacy
coalition frameworkâ€™ (Sabatier, 1988) identify that policy change is the result of formal and
informal interactions between government and other actors around negotiated values and
interests. They identify that actors can no longer be considered in isolation of each other. The
policy network approach provides an analytical toolbox to uncover the interaction between
and among public and private actors leading to policy change. How to define what constitutes Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
36
a policy network (or who to include and exclude) varies in the literature depending on where
researchers decide to put the boundaries of those involved in policy change and why. Kenis
and Schneider (1991) emphasise the informal and horizontal relations driving policy change.
The structure of the policy network, Kriesi et al. (2006) explain, is the main determinant of
policy change noting the distribution of power among participants (fragmented or
concentrated) and the main type of interactions between them (conflict, bargaining or
cooperation) as significant elements in policy networks. The authors note that policy change
is less likely if power is concentrated within a few actors of the policy network, and more likely
if power is fragmented because of the greater chances of the status quo being challenged. The
basic idea behind policy networks and the blurring of boundaries between public and private
spheresreinforces that governmental organisations, the actors formally responsible for policy
decisions, no longer dominate the policy formation and implementation or control policy
direction. Rather, this process is conditional on the increasing social interactions in a given
policy subsystem (Adam, 1999). The pace and scale at which policy change occurs will be
determined by the policy networks capacity and desire to allow for, or challenge, change.
While media are only one component of the governance framework they are seen as having
â€œa crucial responsibility as a source of information and opinionsâ€ (Carvalho, 2007: 223) and as
a significant influencer in how environmental decisions are made and communicated. The
prominent literature on, and scholars in, policy change acknowledge and portray media as
having an important role on political agendas and in the policy change arena (e.g. Sabatier and
Jenkins-Smith, 1993, McCombs and Shaw, 1972, McBeth et al., 2005, Stone, 2012). Even so,
there are two lines of thinking concerning media roles in policy change, media-as-conduit or Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
37
media-as-contributor. Shanahan et al. (2008) tested these two theories, with their research
suggesting that if news outlets support a particular political agenda then this form of media
does in fact assist in driving policy change and could be seen as contributors to the process.
Most notably, however, is that while media are acknowledged in political communication and
policy change scholarship, they are often not considered a key actor in policy change
(Shanahan et al., 2008), nor does this scholarship question how actors obtain, use and
interpret different types of mediated information. In the context of environmental
governance, it is therefore pertinent to explore how media constructs public knowledge about
the environment including who and what â€˜countsâ€™ as key actors, key issues, acceptable and
unacceptable risks, and core values. To understand and analyse how environmental
campaigns and communications affect natural resource governance it is not only important to
identify the actors involved but also their relationships and types of interactions and how this
occurs in the interaction between policy and the public sphere.
Generally, policy studies focus on media influence on elite decision-making while media
studies focus on the effect of media on the mass public, with the former area of research being
less prevalent than the latter. Political communication studies often fail to link media effects
on policy change. This could largely be explained by the often difficult and problematic act of
identifying a causal relationship between any one factor and policy change in complex policy
systems. The influence between media, public opinion and policy change does not constitute
a linear causal relationship but rather this interaction is multidirectional with complex
feedback effects. In this sense, a media role is â€œone of highlighting attributes in a multifaceted
political realityâ€ (Wolfe et al., 2013: 186). Wolfe promotes that â€œthe media agenda is Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
38
simultaneously an input and an output of the political systemâ€, arguing that a media agenda
setting theory which does not acknowledge the actions of government is therefore futile. To
further address this divide between policy and media, Wolfe advocates a research
methodology that â€œfocuses on evaluating the mediaâ€™s role in how political institutions process
informationâ€ integrating a media-as cause and media-as-effect approach.
Similar to the literature on mediaâ€™s role in policy change, the literature on media and public
opinion also lacks consensus regarding whether media expose community expectations or
plays a significant role in shaping community expectations. Additionally, monitoring media for
how an issue is represented (i.e., how solutions or policy alternatives are defined, how issues
and sources of information are being framed, what events are being emphasised) can provide
governing bodies with indicators that assist in revealing, understanding, sorting and
prioritising information in media that is relevant to policy decision-making (Wolfe et al, 2013).
This could also be used by a range of different stakeholders as an indication for how to
improve their communication strategies to ensure a balanced and informed discussion in the
public sphere.
To account for the contemporary role of media, communications and environmental
campaigning in natural resource governance (market mechanisms included), an array of
theories and approaches have developed in political sciences, media and communications
studies to the corporate business literature from which a research approach could be built.
However, links are still required incorporating media, public and policy change, particularly in
a transnational world. Additionally, mediaâ€™s role has been underplayed in existing theories
and needs to be more explicitly unpacked and foregrounded considering it provides a critical Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
39
communication link between claims-makers, decision-makers and publics. I suggest (and
further attempt to do so through the arguments in this thesis) that the concept of governance,
coalitions, networks and the public sphere should underpin further theory development
concerning natural resource governance and mediatised environmental conflict.
2.4 Transnational environmental communication
The study of world politics occurs at a â€œlevel at which norms, values and discourse operate in
the global scale outside the domain of statesâ€ (Wapner, 1996: 42). Ideas and discourses,
around, for example, sustainable production of seafood, are engaging global communities,
transnational organisations, and international policies. This section identifies the major
theories and existing research concerning localised environmental conflict within a
transnational world and for which transnational environmental campaigns and governance
can be understood. The complexities and difficulties around how we are to approach the
complex problem that is environmental conflict in the â€˜transnational public sphereâ€™ is
highlighted when â€˜legitimacyâ€™ and â€˜efficiencyâ€™ of public opinion â€œis not addressed to a
sovereign state that is capable in principle of regulating its territory and solving its citizensâ€™
problems in the public interestâ€ (Fraser, 2007: 15). In the context of considerable and rapid
social, political and technological change, Dahlgren (2005) asks how â€˜publicâ€™ is defined and the
cause and effects of public conflict over environmental futures is increasingly complex.
2.4.1 Transnational environmental campaigning
Transnational activism is commonly seen as the product of the globalisation of markets. While
globalisation is the â€˜whatâ€™ or the cause of contention, it cannot explain the â€˜whenâ€™, â€˜whyâ€™ and
â€˜howâ€™ individuals and groups participate in transnational activism (Tarrow, 2005). Concepts Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
40
such as â€˜transnational advocacy coalitionsâ€™ (Keck and Sikkink, 1998) and â€˜transnational social
movement organisationsâ€™ (Smith et al., 1994) were introduced to describe structured
organisations with members in at least two different countries. While embedded within their
own regions, activists may participate in protest activities in another country but retreat
back to their domestic setting or with international contacts. While protest across the world
is often embedded in a place, there are numerous examples of these protests being enacted
globally or interacting with global mediated politics (Lester, 2019).
Wapner (1996) claims that on the global scale environmental activistsâ€™ function to heighten
the â€˜ecological sensibilityâ€™ of vast numbers of the global population awareness of
environmental problems. Murphy (2012: 480) suggests that â€œNGOs should be considered as
highly strategic, entrepreneurial actors, not just norm-disseminators, in attempting to impact
international policy deliberationsâ€ (specifically the World Trade Organisation). From this,
Murphyâ€™s research concludes that within global policy networks, ENGOs are considered
important actors in setting agendas in international negotiations. Alternatively, Jespersen et
al. (2014) captures the challenges of transnational campaigns in relation to international trade
as he identifies that the negative publicity by NGOs and media campaigns in importing
countries can either go two ways; it can promote more stringent standards for environmental
sustainability, food safety and transparency in exporting countries (via market mechanisms);
or these suppliers will seek alternative export markets which impose fewer demands. These
implications are important considerations in the interaction between local environmental
conflicts and transnational discourses of environmental sustainability. Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
41
2.4.2 Localised environmental risks: Foregrounding the local in a
transnational world
Transnational communications, governance, knowledge, investment and trade (among
others) are pronounced influences in natural resource management. However, as Hutchins
and Lester (2015: 358) state, investigating these complex aspects of media, public and policy
in local environmental governance in an increasingly transnational world is challenging:
To study conflict in this way and at this scale is no small task, encompassing intricate
networks of environmental concern, strategic webs of media and political influence, public
policy debates, and bi- and multi-lateral trade negotiations and deals. Nonetheless, it is
imperative that this research challenge is met, as this is the arena in which global
environmental futures are set to be determined (Hutchins and Lester, 2015: 385).
The scholarship on global communication, policy and trade emphasises the role of the local in
the global and the importance of maintaining a sense of equality between the two scales when
first examining a case. When considering transnational flows and the interaction between
local and global discourses of environmental risks, terms such as â€˜glocalisationâ€™ encompassing
how economic, political and social dynamics occurring at the global scale influence processes
on the local scale and vice versa (Ramutsindela, 2004) and indicate a keen sense of the local
in the global. Local threats and global risks are amalgamated to play a role in the decision
making of each (Lester, 2016a). Similarly, ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ  (2015) state that high-level
regional and national policies should never discount local community attitudes and interests
because the local level is the level of implementation. If local preferences and values are
disregarded, coupled with the growth of a sector, it becomes a recipe for disaster (ErtÃ¶r and
Ortega-CerdaÌ€, 2015). They argue that lessons from these conflicts should underpin the future Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
42
management of this food production sector. When national and international networks or
coalitions are formed, local and global conflict discourses are intertwined and subsequent
arguments are the product of a glocal process (Swyngedouw, 1997).
Exploring how different stakeholders obtain and process information regarding the
sustainability of seafood is inherently complicated as transnational supply chains are
becoming central to natural resources use and production. Scholarship on global
communication, policy and trade emphasises the role of the local in the global and the
importance of maintaining a sense of equality between the two, both being as important as
each other. Furthermore, literature regarding transnational communications clearly
advocates the importance of foregrounding local discussions and social interactions when
undertaking research into transnational communications (Lester, 2014: 169, Kraidy and
Murphy, 2008). Kraidy and Murphy (2008) suggest that the local is the â€˜linchpinâ€™ of global
communication studies. In understanding that the local is intrinsically â€˜dynamic and dialogicalâ€™,
Kraidy and Murphy advocate an approach to the local that acknowledges its accessibility for
studying meaning, power relations and negotiation as it emerges between â€˜contextually
situated social agentsâ€™. Lester (2014: 169) also highlights the link between localised concerns
and global discourses of risk by suggesting â€œin seeking to empirically investigate emerging
conditions of transnational publicâ€¦it is necessary to foreground the local as a dominant critical
reality within environmental politicsâ€. Lester justifies this by explaining that â€œlocal individuals
and communities carry the anxieties and lived realities of damaged environmentsâ€ from
resource extractive or production activities (e.g. communities in the vicinity of salmon farms)
to provide goods and services to distant markets (e.g. Asia). Local threats and global risks are Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
43
each synthesised into symbolic discourses to play a role in the decision-making of the other
(Lester, 2016a).
Urkidi (2010) makes the connection between the scaling-up strategy and glocalisation as
strategic schemes to access political opportunities and forces the opposition to engage in such
discourse. For example, the importance placed on the localised environmental impacts of fin
fish aquaculture in international discourse of global consumption of sustainable seafood is
promoted by supralocal actors (those which transcend location or are associated with more
than one location). Illustrating this, Olsen and Osmundsen (2017)â€™s media analysis of salmon
aquaculture in Norway highlights that perceptions of aquaculture and the associated
environmental risks might be influenced to a greater extent when these risks are associated
with global environmental discourses compared with actual or experienced reality at the site
of production (see also Bocking (2012) who investigates transnational flows of scientific
information concerning salmon aquaculture across news media between Europe and Canada).
Forming a global definition for best practices or environmental sustainability is challenging
considering the local and regional context is a fundamental component in the definition and
application of sustainability in global standards (MithÃ¶fer et al., 2017). For example,
disagreements between activists and global private governance mechanisms such as third
party certifications create tensions around defining acceptability and confusion for
corporations when two seemingly similar stakeholders have different views about how to
achieve sustainability. These ideological differences create heated debates and remain
unresolved, making transnational environmental conflicts new battlegrounds (Auld, 2020).
There is a lot atstake with these types of conflictsrisk for a company such asloss of reptuationChapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
44
and brand damage. The complexity of transnational debates regarding environmental risk is
summarised by Lester (2016: 1):
â€˜How can responsibility be allocated and appropriate responses determined and demanded
when the arenas for politics, law, communications and risks themselves now cross state
boundaries; when the relationship between citizens, corporations and decision-makers is
further complicated by transnational networks of economics and trade, governance and
law, and media and communications?â€™ (Lester, 2016: 1)
Highly resourced and influential environmental campaigns are increasingly alerting distant
buyers and consumers about the local impacts of the goods and materials they have access
to. Despite the market-focus of these campaigns they have direct consequences for public
policy processes which, as Kenis and Schneider (1991) explain, have experienced; an increase
in scope, decentralisation, blurring of boundaries between public and private actors; and,
transnationalisation of domestic politics. As Ruggie (2004: 504) adds, there is an â€œincreasingly
institutionalised transnational arena of discourse, contestation, and action concerning the
production of global public goods, involving private as well as public actorsâ€. This creates an
atmosphere of â€œshared risks and responsibilitiesâ€ within a global community (Lester, 2014:
168). For transnational networks of ENGOs and grass roots lobby groups to influence the
operations of large transnational corporations, they seek to mobilise support at various
locations and distances from the actual site of contention. This puts local issues on the political
agenda of other countries thus turning local conflicts into transnational ones, therefore their
influence on policy formation should not be underestimated (Holzer, 2001). Adding to this,
Beckâ€™s (1996) â€˜global risk societyâ€™ and â€˜cosmopolitismâ€™ encompass world-wide Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
45
communications and global environmental risks, whereby political borders are transcended
boundaries. This risk â€œcan be dramatized or minimized, transformed or simply denied
according to the norms that decide what is known and what is not.â€ (Beck, 2011: 1349).
Furthermore, Hutchins and Lester (2015) explain that campaigning at the transnational level
is likely to continue to become more prominent in world politics as the international trade of
natural resources increases and the environmental risks are shared by both the locally
affected and the global community.
In the context of aquaculture, ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ  (2015: 209) warn against the insufficient
regard for local attitudes in a growth industry. The authors identify the need for further
investigation into an â€œeffective participatory decision-making mechanism â€¦ ensuring access
to transparent information and an equitable social distribution of burdens, benefits and risks
resulting from aquaculture activitiesâ€ (ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ  2015: 209). Yet, there has been
limited research that investigates the transnational elements of environmental conflicts, with
this gap particularly evident in aquaculture studies, and how this affects local environmental
governance. For instance, we do not fully understand how campaign messages are
transmitted from the local conflicts into target markets and what this means for resources,
such as salmon, that already experience a significant level of conflict, or are already under
pressure from current market pressures. The current scholarship is only beginning to explore
how these global dimensions affect local discourses and governance and how these changes
in local discourse and governance in turn affect global discourses and governance. This
research agenda becomes increasingly important as the transnational dimensions of seafood
grows, with progression in, for example, global third-party certification (Foley and Havice, Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
46
2016), international markets (Fabinyi, 2007) global environmental campaigning (Baird and
Quastel, 2011), and sharing of information (Bocking, 2012).
2.5 Seafood as a critical case
Seafood products are some of the most highly traded food commodities globally (FAO, 2018).
Seafood plays a critical role in the food security and employment of millions of people around
the world. Seafood is made up of wild capture fisheries and aquaculture. While wild capture
is the capture of marine animals, generally using nets or hook and line, aquaculture is
essentially marine agriculture where aquatic species are farmed in marine and freshwater
environments. Worldwide demand for seafood and fish products is increasing (Figure 2). This
demand for seafood, driven by a growing population, particularly the Asian middle class,
requires the increased use of natural resources globally (Cao et al., 2017). The value of fishery
and aquaculture products entering international trade doubled from 1998-2008, with nearly
40% of production entering the international market as various food and feed products in
2008 (FAO, 2010). Global fish production reached its peak in 2016 with a total of 171 million
tonnes from both wild capture fisheries and aquaculture with a total value of USD 362 billion
(first sale value) (Figure 3). Aquaculture accounted for 47% of the volume and USD 232 billion
(FAO, 2018). As demand and trade increase, wild capture fisheries have a limited capacity to
provide seafood into the future. Wild capture production has remained relatively steady since
the 1980s (Figure 3) but is expected to decrease. Concerns of overfishing have been present,
and contested, in the academic literature for decades (Froese and Kesner-Reyes, 2002, Edgar
et al., 2018, Sumaila and Tai, 2020). Worm et al. (2006) predicted that by 2048 all fish stocks
will have collapsed. Overfishing has long been acknowledged as a prominent environmental Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
47
and socioeconomic problem with an array of solutions now at the forefront of the debate of
fisheries management. Such solutions often stipulate the need for reduced capture rates. For
example, closing the high seas (international waters) to wild capture fishing has been
proposed to allow for fish stocks to recover (PeÃ±alosa Martinell et al., 2020).
Figure 2: World fish utilisation and consumption (Source: FAO, 2018)
Figure 3: World fish production from wild capture fisheries and aquaculture (Source: FAO, 2018)Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
48
Comparative to the decline in wild capture, seafood production from aquaculture is
continually increasing and technologies advancing (FAO, 2016). Aquaculture is fast becoming
the most stable source of seafood to meet increasing demand with a 19.6% increase in
production from 2000-2015. Of this production, over half was consistently made up of fin-fish.
Meanwhile, wild capture production remained relatively steady over this 15-year period (FAO,
2017a, FAO, 2017b) (Figure 3). Aquaculture has allowed for consumption reaching a record
high of 20kg per capita fish supply annually (FAO, 2016) (Figure 2) and any significant increase
in fish supply in the future is expected to come primarily from aquaculture production
(Godfray et al., 2010). With fish continually being one of the most traded food commodities
globally, the world per capita annual fish consumption is expected to go beyond 20kg. This
growth in demand combined with wild stocks expected to decrease due to environmental
pressures of over-fishing means aquaculture is expected to expand to fill this gap in supply
(FAO, 2014). However, as with wild capture fisheries, aquaculture is not immune to
environmental and social issues and limitations; for example, impacts on the surrounding
water quality and benthic substrate, the use of wild fish in fish feed, pathogens and disease
and animal welfare (Cottrell et al., 2018). Often the farming practice relies on continued and
growing access to highly contested multi-use common pool marine coastal waters to ensure
continued supply for desirable fish products. Some of the most contested debates over natural
resource use occur regarding the coastal zone, where a range of interests, information and
knowledge often diverge regarding use and preservation of resources. This makes
development and implementation of coastal policy and management schemes particularly
difficult (Foxwell-Norton, 2018).Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
49
Controversy regarding aquaculture is said to be increasing despite scientific and engineering
advances in mitigating environmental impacts (Young and Matthews, 2010). While science
plays a key role in understanding and managing the effects of aquaculture on the natural
environment, research by Osmundsen et al. (2017) finds that much of the public debate
concerning salmon aquaculture is value laden. Osmundsen and co-authors explain that the
problem â€œbecomes a social construct interpreted in political and moral termsâ€¦moving away
from purely scientific understandingâ€¦ and both the scientific debate and discussions on how
to manage and govern the industry become politicizedâ€. Maeseele (2015b: 280) suggests that
â€œconflicting (and contested) claims to knowledge are found to be selectively adopted by
various social actors as a material and discursive resource in pursuing broader social,
economic or political agendasâ€. In the case of an environmental campaign against a large
fishing trawler in Australia, Tracey et al. (2013) argues that selective and potentially
misinformed environmental campaigns failed to acknowledge the full process of fisheries
management and yet were successful in gathering a national following and provoking the
federal Environment Minister to alter national environmental laws and disregard previously
adopted scientific advice to ban the vessel from fishing in Australian waters. Cash et al. (2006:
466) write that the act of linking science and technology to decision-making in ways that are
more â€œsocially embedded and that attempt to balance economic, cultural and social needsâ€ is
a critical shortcoming and a challenging aspect of environmental governance. This combined
with the increasingly complex transnational flows of information and resources is evidence of
an urgent need for more work to be done regarding the construction and flow of information
within environmental politics and how this influences marine resource governance (market
mechanisms included). Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts

2.6 Salmon aquaculture as a seafood case
Aquaculture is seen as the future for seafood production and an important economic
contributor to regional communities, however it has environmental and social impacts just as
wild fisheries do (Newton and Little, 2018). The livelihoods and environments of regional
communities surrounding aquaculture development have also been profoundly impacted by
globalisation. Salmon aquaculture has been a source of contention in many countries that
farm fish in their coastal waters (e.g. B.C. Canada, Chile, Norway and Denmark) forming a
global discourse of local risks. The industry is no stranger to mediatised public conflict, with a
number of scholars exploring how the industry is represented in media in different growing
regions (Amberg and Hall, 2010, Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017, Sha et al., 2015). Amberg and
Hall (2010) analysed news content for environment and human heath within the U.S. and
found that negative coverage of salmon aquaculture was more prominent (Amberg and Hall,
2008). In Germany, the most frequent attributes of salmon aquaculture evident in the news
media were the economy, environment, human health, animal welfare and regulation
respectively (Feucht and Zander, 2017). In Norway, industry, politics and environment were
common topics in media (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017).
Aquaculture is a growth industry and will continue to supply the rising demand for fish for
human consumption while capture fisheries remain relatively stable. By 2030 the aquaculture
sector is predicted to supply 62% of fish for human consumption (World Bank, 2014). Global
aquaculture production in 2016 comprised mostly of food fish (73% or 80 million tonnes) with
the remaining being aquatic plants (30.1 million tonnes), as well as a very small amount (37
900 tonnes) of non-food products. Of the farmed food fish 68% is fin-fish. Since 2013, salmon Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
51
has been the largest fish commodity globally by value with trade in salmon increasing by 10%
per year since 1976. Salmon has become a popular product in global markets with
international marketing campaigns causing a rapid rise in demand. Yet the limited availability
of appropriate farming sites and regulatory constraints due to disease, pathogen and
environmental impacts have meant that production has not increased with the same vigour
as the demand. This demand and supply ratio have meant the price of salmon has rapidly
increased (FAO, 2018).
Salmon aquaculture provides a unique, timely and important opportunity to explore how local
and transnational how mediatised environmental conflicts unfold across scale for five main
reasons: 1) salmon consumption globally has tripled since 1980 with salmon aquaculture
being the fasted growing food production system in the world accounting for over 70% of the
market (World Wide Fund for Nature, 2020); 2) farming salmon relies on access to publicly
owned common pool coastal resources; 3) the sector is experiencing rapidly evolving
advancements in environmental monitoring and farming technology (Asche et al., 2018); 4)
the marine open-pen farming practice has environmental (Ross and Macleod, 2017) and social
(Pitchon, 2015) impacts; and 5) because of these impacts the sectorâ€™s expansion has
instigated considerable public debate and conflict (demonstrated by heightened media
attention and targeted environmental campaigns) over the management of the
environmental and social impacts on local though to global scales (Tiller et al., 2012, Adler,
2002, Young and Liston, 2010, Osmundsen and Olsen, 2017).
As with many industries, salmon aquaculture has shifted from an industry traditionally
characterised by small, often family owned, farms and local markets to the corporatisation of Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
52
the industry, transnational companies, international investment and growing export markets.
As of 2015, salmon aquaculture occurred in 13 countries with five of these accounting for
95.5% of global production: Norway (55.3%) along with Scotland (7.6%) and Faroe Islands
(3.3%) in Europe, Chile (25.4%) and Canada (6%). The other eight countries produce the
remaining 4.4 % (Iversen et al., 2020). Countries that lack indigenous stock rely on imported
eggs. Chile is one of these countries and therefore Norwegian companies have a considerable
presence in Chile, making Norway a key player in the global Atlantic Salmon industry. Of the
20 largest salmon aquaculture companies, 11 of them are headquartered in Norway (Berge,
2017). Mowi (formally Marine Harvest) is the largest producer of salmon operating in 22
countries and supplying salmon to over 50 markets. The limiting factor to further global
expansion is the availability of appropriate sites and therefore any shortage in production in
one country cannot be easily compensated for by another. This means the global market can
be considerably affected by the production of a few countries.
Technologies are advancing at a rapid rate to resolve challenges of producing large amounts
of fish for food consumption within acceptable limits of social and environmental impact.
More recently, the salmon industry globally is advancing technology in order to move to
higher energy sites (which are generally characterised as further offshore with deeper water,
strong currents and higher wave energy) and grow smolt to a larger size on land to limit their
time in the marine environment (Ramsden, 2018). However, until these technologies
successfully meet societal expectations the industry and its regulatory mechanisms are the
source of considerable public criticism and debate. Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
53
As the industry has expanded, the farming practice has been a source of contention around
the world, made visible in media (Schlag, 2011, Amberg and Hall, 2008, Olsen and Osmundsen,
2017). The controversy over salmon aquaculture is complex with a multitude of competing
claims from a range of stakeholders across scales. This has been characterised as the â€œsalmon
warsâ€ (Beckett, 2012) and dubbed â€œthe most divisive and intense struggles over industrial
development to have ever taken place in Canadaâ€ (Young and Matthews, 2010: 3).
Environmental and industrial conflicts have become increasingly complex and
multidimensional as society has become less tolerant of risk and uncertainty (Young and
Matthews, 2010). However, there are common themes in salmon aquaculture debates
summarised by Young and Matthews (2010) as â€œaxes of controversyâ€: environment, human
health, rights (and access) and rural development. Much of the ongoing public debates are
centred around sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability. At the site of
production these debates are related to a range of risks including: negative impacts on the
surrounding water quality and biodiversity of a marine farm, fish escapes and impacts on wild
fish populations, for countries that have native wild Atlantic salmon genetic impacts on wild
stocks, for countries that experience parasite problems (lice) and their treatments and animal
welfare (of both farmed fish and surrounding marine life) (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017).
In order to continue to grow and maintain its position as a major player in global food
production, the salmon aquaculture sector depends on a positive public image (Schlag, 2010,
Amberg and Hall, 2008), broad public acceptance, and a social licence to operate (Leith et al.,
2014b). To enhance the industryâ€™s public image and address environmental externalities at
the global scale, the Global Salmon Initiative was founded in 2013 by salmon farming Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
54
companies from Norway, Chile and Scotland in an effort to improve environmental reputation
by facilitating discussions to â€œlook at ways they [the industry] could break down barriers to
environmental improvement in the salmon aquaculture sectorâ€ (Global Salmon Initiative,
2020). The industry group brings together 14 salmon farming companies from eight countries
(Australia, Canada, Chile, Faroe Islands, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United
Kingdom), representing ~50% of the global salmon aquaculture sector. This initiative frames
the sector as united in its role in producing a healthy source of protein for a growing
population. Collaborative efforts are promoted between salmon farming and feed companies,
veterinary organisations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and Worldwide Fund
for Nature (WWF). This includes co-hosting a â€œthought leaders discussion at the World Bankâ€
with WWF. It represents shared goals of environmental sustainability, corporation and
transparency in three key industry areas to achieve global outcomes: third-party certification,
sustainable salmon feed and biosecurity. Third-party certification (specifically Aquaculture
Stewardship Council) is endorsed as the key mechanism for measuring progress and
communicating commitments to such endeavours.
A third-party certification label is one of the few ways for customers to determine what is
considered to be sustainable seafood and for producers to inform purchasers and consumers
regarding sustainable practices (Hatanaka et al., 2005). It is expected that these standards and
benchmarks will eventually be determined under circumstances where scientific experts are
one of many contributors of information, knowledge and interests (Rice, 2014). Despite
efforts to standardise the definition for sustainable seafood, â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ has been so
overused as a marketing tool that some argue it has become meaningless and lost its value Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
55
and impact (McEwan and Bek, 2009). There are also concerns that external sustainability
assessments could undermine government authority (Crona et al., 2016). In the case of
aquaculture exports from Asia, some Asian suppliers have adopted third-party certification
schemes in order to export to EU and US markets that have strong NGO and media presence,
while others have sought out new market destinations such as Russia and the Middle East
which impose lower sustainability requirements.
WWF and the Sustainable Trade Initiative co-founded the Aquaculture Stewardship
Certification (ASC) in 2010 with the aim of providing global standards for environmentally and
socially responsible seafood farming (Aquaculture Stewardship Council, 2020). The ASC was
an output from the Aquaculture Dialogues, a series of multi-stakeholder roundtables lasting
over a decade starting from 2004 in cities around the world, coordinated by WWF. The
dialogues were promoted as an open and transparent process focussed on â€œminimising the
key environmental and social impacts of aquacultureâ€ by developing standards that are
â€œscience-based, performance-based and metrics-based and globally applicable to aquaculture
production systems, covering many types, locations and scales of operationsâ€. Each dialogue
developed standards for one farmed seafood species, with initial species (which included
salmon) being chosen based on their level of environmental and social impact, market value
and the extent to which they are traded internationally (Aquaculture Stewardship Council,
2020). This highlights that the environmental management of salmon aquaculture has been
prominent in global governance agendas. The contestation over industrial growth, trade,
knowledge and who carries this knowledge and governance approaches makes salmon Chapter 2 | Theoretical, analytical and knowledge contexts
56
aquaculture an ideal case study to examine mediatised information flows and local and
transnational interactions.3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study

SALMON AQUACULTURE
IN TASMANIA,
AUSTRALIA:
THE CASE STUDY3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
58
3.1 Introduction
The impact of global growth and related controversy in aquaculture has been reflected in
Tasmania, Australia, where the salmon aquaculture industry experienced considerable
growth, accompanied by publicised societal debate at the time of this research. Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture has a long history of contention since industry conception through the
1980s-1990s. The initial venture in the 1980s was between the Tasmanian State Government
and Noraqua, a Norwegian company. The development of a large hatchery using European
technology accelerated the Tasmanian industry. By 2018, the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry (which also comprises a small amount of rainbow trout) was worth $838.3 million,
with a 17% increase in production volume in 2017-2018 and was Australiaâ€™s most valuable
aquaculture product (Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment, 2020). Three
main companies now farm salmon in Tasmania: Tassal, the largest of the three, is a publicly
listed company; Huon Aquaculture, a family founded company that floated 30% on the ASX in
2014; and Petuna, the smallest of the three is family founded and has not publicly listed.
Tasmanian salmon farms have traditionally been located in estuaries and sheltered marine
waters on the west and south coasts of the island state. However, since recent plans to
significantly expand the industry (Fleming et al., 2017), the industry has been the focus of
various environmental conflicts (see Vince and Haward, 2017, Leith et al., 2014b, Murphy
Gregory, 2017). In 2009, the industry announced its target to double by 2030 to a $1 billion a
year industry (DPIPWE, 2017). This growth agenda is shared and supported by the Tasmanian
Government (Tasmanian Government, 2013). Both the Australian federal government and the
Tasmanian government have remained committed to the expansion of the industry despite 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
59
being criticised for their perceived unwavering support for the exploitation of the
environment and public waterways to support economic growth, and profit for particular
companies (Tiller et al., 2012, Vince and Haward, 2017). The government and industry assured
the expansion was supported by â€˜the scienceâ€™. However, for the affected coastal communities
that â€œmay not know the coast in science and technology, but they do know where they liveâ€
(Foxwell-Norton, 2018: 2), the claim of scientific support provided little reassurance and
conflicts became increasingly visible on social and news media. Protests characterised by
fleets of boats have become a feature of the social debate over Tasmanian waters and were
readily organised and attended by ENGOs and recreational fishers. The alliance between these
two typically polar groups was first established from previous protests against the FV Margiris
â€˜super trawlerâ€™ (Cullen-Knox et al., 2017b, Tracey et al. 2013).
Australian identity, lifestyle and livelihoods are strongly linked with the coastal landscape,
with 80% of the countryâ€™s population living within 50km of the ocean. This identity is firmly
engrained in Tasmanian culture whereby its remoteness and relatively poorer economic
conditions compared to the rest of Australia is compensated for by the affordability of â€˜shackâ€™
(holiday dwellings) ownership, easy access to the oceans, lakes and estuaries with one in every
17 Tasmanians owning a registered boat (ABC News, 2014a). Additionally, the island state has
a rich, antagonistic history of environmental politics cultivated over decades (see Schirmer et
al., 2016, Lester and Hutchins, 2009). Tasmania, about 20% of which is listed as wilderness
World Heritage and 135,100 ha of Marine Protected Areas, is home to the worldâ€™s first green
party and renowned campaign against the Franklin Dam (Lester, 2006); a long history of
transnational forestry â€˜warsâ€™ (Lester, 2016a); and increasing conflict in the marine sector, 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
60
including the national campaign against the FV Margiris â€˜super trawlerâ€™ (Cullen-Knox et al.,
2017b, Tracey et al. 2013). The island state now has generations that have experienced this
conflict, which has entrenched the discourse of economic growth versus environmental
impact in almost all aspects of Tasmanian culture and society (see Figure 4). Most notably,
regional environmental groups have formed both local and transnational coalitions and
networks and this expertise is now being applied to the salmon industry. However, Lester
(2019: 109) explains the changes in the conflicts between forestry and salmon including: â€œthe
visible alliances between key actors; in the explicit representation of localâ€“global tensions;
and in scienceâ€™s role in mediated debateâ€.
Figure 4: Cartoonist Jon Kudelka illustrating the legacy of â€œtension between environment and growthâ€ and
apparent resentment of this prevalent and re-occurring discourse in Tasmania (Kudelka, 2017).
The intractability of environmental conflict in Tasmania was exemplified by the Hobart
Mercury:
There are those who, regardless of the science presented, will never, ever accept the
practice. Likewise, opponents are too easily dismissed as agitators or extremists. In our 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
61
experience many are not. They are people with valid concerns. Their views need to be
listened to. Too many issues in Tasmania are divided into streams of black and white.
Forestry is a key example. You are with us or you are against us. But so much of the
community operates in the grey space in between. (The Hobart Mercury, 2017)
These conflicts are reinforced by â€œvicious cycles of distrustâ€ concerning use of science
information and claim-making, stemming from â€œcherry-picking, secrecy and
misinterpretationâ€ (Leith et al., 2014b:290). In this cycle, â€œreputational capital is traded away
by all parties in costly, unproductive, and acrimonious processesâ€ destabilising the â€˜social
license to operateâ€™. By contrast, virtuous cycles are â€œdeliberate, slow and consideredâ€ and are
characterised by shared â€œgoals and languageâ€ creating trust between and among stakeholder
groups (Leith et al., 2014b: 291).
The conflict reached new heights of contention in 2015-2017 between and among the salmon
industry, political decision-makers, ENGOs, local community and other recreational and
commercial users of coastal waters and science providers. During this time, the Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture industry appeared to lose what it had previously referred to as its enviable
â€˜social licenceâ€™ (Sams, 2015). The industry had earned this (perceived) â€˜community
acceptanceâ€™ (at the local level) and â€˜socio-political acceptanceâ€™ (at the broader level)
(WÃ¼stenhagen et al., 2007) over previous decades by bringing a new industry to the otherwise
economically struggling southern island state of Australia. Importantly, it had done this with
few visible impacts on the much fought over Tasmanian environment.
The conflict largely became visible through two events â€“ a Senate Inquiry in 2015 into the
â€œregulation of the fin-fish aquaculture industry in Tasmaniaâ€ and a piece of investigative 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
62
journalism broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 2016 on its flagship
current affairs program Four Corners, the episode titled â€˜Big Fishâ€™ (see sections 3.2 and 3.3
respectively). Following these events, the conflict was further entrenched by and continues as
key legal and political actions are undertaken between key actors. Leading up to this there has
been a chain of events that intensified the conflict (Table 2).

63
In 2012 the industryâ€™s application to expand the farming practices in Macquarie Harbour was
approved. As a precaution, the proposed expansion was staged. Following increases in the
stocking limit, initial concerns regarding the environmental carrying capacity of the harbour
were identified in 2014 (Huon Aquaculture, 2017). At this point the State Government at the
time changed the management scheme in the harbour from biomass limits to a percentage
given to each company, resulting in a larger allocation to Tassal. The conflict and lack of unity
between companies was observable from this moment and lead to the Senate Inquiry (see
section 3.2) and followed the Four Corners Episode (see section 3.3).
These localised tensions were amplified and complicated as the Australian federal
government signed free trade agreements with Asian export markets in 2015. The Australian
Governments enthusiasm and commitment to these markets is highlighted in reports such as
the governmentâ€™s 2012 white paper, â€˜Australia in the Asian Centuryâ€™ and the subsequent 2013
white paper â€˜Tasmaniaâ€™s place in the Asian Centuryâ€™. These high impact papers predicted that
the transnational flow of personnel, investment, resources and information would increase
and congregate in the Asian region. The impact is exemplified by Tassal opening an office in
Shanghai in 2017.
In mid-2016, responsibility for environmental regulation of the Tasmanian salmon industry
was transferred to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). This was in response to
concerns regarding the independence of the Tasmanian State Government (acting as both the
proponent and regulator of the salmon industry) identified from the Senate Inquiry. At the
same time, Macquarie Harbourâ€™s stocking cap was further increased (Environmental
Defenders Office Tasmania, 2018).3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
64
Following conflict over allocation and environmental capacity in Macquarie Harbour,
expansion into new, previously unfarmed areas, characterised as more oceanic sites, was
proposed by all three salmon companies farming in Tasmania. In early 2016, Tassal applied to
expand its operations into Okehampton Bay on the islandâ€™s East Coast, a previously unfarmed
region. The company applied to take over an existing aquaculture lease originally granted in
1999, which was put to the Marine Farming Review Panel to assess its suitability to farm
salmon. This Panel comprised government-appointed experts in marine science, marine
farming, marine resource management, environmental management, local government and
planning.
Expansion into new lease sites instigated â€œconflflict in terms of difffferent values for difffferent
stakeholders concerning the same resource, such as recreational, cultural, commercial and
ecological values" (Fleming et al., 2017). In February 2017, the then sustainability manager for
Tassal, Tasmaniaâ€™s largest salmon farming company, wrote an article in the Hobart Mercury
stating:
In recent months, however, Tasmaniaâ€™s nearly $700 million-a-year salmon aquaculture
industry has been facing unprecedented scrutiny in the media â€” locally and nationally.
Weâ€™re being challenged by some â€” but not all â€” environmentalists, politicians, scientists,
community members and other waterway users to prove that our industry is sustainable â€”
and if not we should slow, redirect or even halt its growth. (Sams, 2017)
Okehampton Bay is a favourite holiday destination for Tasmanians and an area new to salmon
farming making it one of the more controversial expansion proposals. Community opposition
to Tassalâ€™s expansion was made increasingly apparent in early 2016. Local opposition groups,3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
65
Marine Protection Tasmania and Letâ€™s Grow Tasmaniaâ€™s Future, were formed in response to
Tassalâ€™s expansion into Okehampton Bay. The latter group was responsible for an
advertisement distributed on television, their website and Facebook page, beginning its online
presence approximately two months after the Four Corners program.
Tassal was the first company in the world to gain Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)
certification across all of its sites (ABC News, 2014b). This was later also achieved by Petuna
in 2016 with Huon Aquaculture gaining ASC certification for one of its sites in 2017 (World
Wide Fund for Nature, 2018). However, Tassal forfeited ASC certification for leases in
Macquarie Harbour in 2016 and was ordered by the EPA to destock their lease closest to a
World Heritage area by February 2017.
During this time, local ENGOs inaccurately assumed Tassal retained ASC certification. Key
lobby group Environment Tasmania made claims that the ASC audit process, along with
Tassals partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), was faulty and corrupt.
Environment Tasmania initiated a petition â€œdemanding that all certifications for Macquarie
Harbour be suspended and a full and transparent review of just how Tassal has retained ASC
certification while breaching key ASC standards for more than 18 monthsâ€ (Environment
Tasmania, 2016b). However, an auditorâ€™s report found that the ASC standard was correctly
applied in the case of Tassalâ€™s Macquarie Harbour leases. Any non-conformities were correctly
classified and closed out according to the ASC methodology during surveillance audits (see
SCS Global Services, 2017). However, the report acknowledges that the ASC standard is
globally applicable and local conditions might require a different approach. The auditors state
that the standard may require changes, based on further scientific monitoring and potentially 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
66
a change of monitoring methods, to address local environmental impacts (SCS Global Services,
2017):
The ASC standards have been developed to be globally applicable with international multi
stakeholder engagement over may years. Local conditions may vary greatly from one site to
another and, in some cases, a different approach might be necessary to deliver more
accurate assessments. Identifying these and feeding them into the standard review process
is important for the development of the standard. The audit team has committed to do that
and will provide all standard specific issues to the ASC for their consideration. (SCS Global
Services, 2017: 86)
The ABCâ€™s â€˜Big Fishâ€™ was a turning point. In the program, Huon Aquaculture (the second largest
salmon producer and Tassalâ€™s major competitor) was portrayed as environmentally conscious.
By February 2017, the company had broken industry ranks by leaving the stateâ€™s seafood
industry organisation and beginning unprecedented legal action against the state and federal
governments for â€œfail[ing] to manage and protect the environment in Macquarie Harbourâ€
(Meldrum-Hanna, 2017). While, if successful, Huon Aquacultureâ€™s biggest rival, Tassal, would
have been impacted the most, the court case represents a remarkable move for a company
to legally fight for tougher environmental regulations. Tassal, represented as a â€œCorporate
Juggernautâ€ in the Four Corners episode, joined the proceedings in support of the
government. This deepened the conflict between salmon aquaculture companies. While Huon
eventually lost the court case (Shine, 2018), it was said to have won a social licence by being
seen to care about the environmental sustainability of the plundered Macquarie Harbour
when no other authority appeared to (Thompson, 2018).3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
67
Later in 2017, the Tasmanian State Government released the â€˜Sustainable industry growth
planâ€™ stipulating â€˜growâ€™ and â€˜no-growâ€™ zones in an effort to â€œachieve growth in a sustainable,
transparent and accountable wayâ€ (Tasmanian Government, 2017b, Tasmanain Government,
2019). However, lack of transparency in the process of producing this map was expressed in a
submission by the lead marine environmental campaigner for Environment Tasmania during
the public consultation period, arguing that the processes by which government had taken to
produce â€œgoâ€ and â€œno goâ€ zones were ambiguous. This followed years of media debate
regarding what was considered adequate approaches to transparency regarding the
sustainability of industry. These media narratives regarding environmental risks of industry
expansion, adequacy of regulation and governance mechanisms and the communication of
these processes provide the backdrop for this research.
3.2 The Senate Inquiry into the regulation of fin-fish aquaculture
industry in Tasmanian
A string of events leading up to the Senate Inquiry began with an email written in 2014 by
Huon Aquaculture and Petuna addressed to the then Tasmanian Premier and Minister for
Primary Industries and Water detailing concerns of high stocking rates, environmental impacts
and inadequate regulatory approaches. Of particular concern was that Tassal would exceed
their stocking limit. This email was leaked to the Greens party, which tabled it in the State
Parliament. In the upper house of the Federal Parliament, the Greens proposed a Senate
Inquiry into the matter and a reduction in stocking limits to represent pre-expansion numbers.
The Tasmanian Premier declared the Inquiry a â€œwitch huntâ€ (ABC News, 2015b). On 24 March
2015, the Senate referred the matter of the â€œregulation of the fin-fish aquaculture industry in
Tasmaniaâ€ for Inquiry which consisted of a period open to public written submissions, a two-3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
68
day hearing process (15 and 16 July 2015) and a final report due by 21 August 2015. The
Inquiry investigated:
(a) â€œthe adequacy and availability of data on waterway health;
(a) the impact on waterway health, including to threatened and endangered species;
(a) the adequacy of current environmental planning and regulatory mechanisms;
(a) the interaction of state and federal laws and regulation;
(a) the economic impacts and employment profile of the industry; and
(a) any other relevant matters.â€ (Commonwealth of Australia, 2015)
The Committee advertised the Inquiry on its website, in the Australian (a nationally distributed
newspaper), and wrote directly to what it considered relevant organisations and individuals
inviting submissions by 1 June 2015. The Committee received 103 submissions of which 15
were confidential. Anyone could make a submission to the Senate Inquiry, which presented
information in a way that transparently identified sources and was structured to allow for
public decision-makers to respond. The majority of submissions were made by local residents
and businesses. Both national and regional ENGOs and government agencies also made
submissions.
One of the main outcomes of the Senate Inquiry was the debate that was instigated
concerning the adequacy of environmental regulations and the tension presented by the
government acting as both proponent and regulator. 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
69
3.3 Four Corners episode â€˜Big Fishâ€™
Following years of expansion, regulatory changes and environmental campaigning, an
historically Tasmanian-contained conflict was broadcast to audiences Australia-wide in 2016
by the Four Corners episode â€˜Big Fishâ€™. This was aired nationally on television by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), dedicating an hour-long segment to the salmon aquaculture
industry in Tasmania on 31 October 2016. The program prompted a social media frenzy and
almost tripled news media attention (Outlined in detail in Chapter 5).
The program focused on salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast (which was
the focus of the Senate Inquiry) and the then proposed lease at Okehampton Bay on the East
Coast, both close to world heritage and marine protected areas. The program interviewed the
following: representatives of two of the three main salmon companies; a representative of a
salmon feed company; an American lawyer; a Melbourne-based scientist; a Tasmanian mussel
farmer; representatives of two Tasmanian ENGOs (Environment Tasmania, a prominent
environmental campaign organisation in Tasmania, and Marine Protection Tasmania a
relatively newer organisation); a representative of one transnational ENGO (WWF); and local
business owners, mayors and various community members.
The Four Corners program discussed issues of expansion, lack of transparency and regulatory
rigour and environmental and aesthetic impacts that were also present in the Senate Inquiry
submissions. The program depicted the salmon industry as â€œpowerfulâ€ and expansion as
something that needs to be â€œreined-inâ€ (Meldrum-Hanna, 2016). The program played a
substantial role in portraying Tassal as a â€œcorporate juggernautâ€ by revealing a perceived lack
of transparency, apparent disregard for the environment and community mobilisation against 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
70
the company's East Coast proposal. Meanwhile, the program portrayed Huon Aquaculture as
the humble, environmentally conscious company and â€œone of Tasmania's greatest home
grown success storiesâ€ (ABC, 2016).
The Four Corners program highlighted community anxieties concerning the expansion of the
industry, particularly regarding Tassal's East Coast farming operations. This appeared to stem
from the perceived lack of transparency, of Tassal in particular, amplified in the program by
appearing to uncover internal Tassal documents and communications. For the first known
time in the public debate concerning the adequacy of environmental governance of the
Tasmanian salmon industry, the credibility of the WWF and the ASC Certification, which WWF
co-founded as noted earlier, was brought into question. The risk to the ENGOâ€™s reputation
was amplified due to claims made that its independence was compromised by the
accreditation services work it was paid to do for Tassal. This professional exchange of services
between Tassal and WWF was already publicly disclosed by both parties prior to the Four
Corners episode.
In â€˜Big Fishâ€™, the EPA was depicted as lacking regulatory rigour and ignoring advice from Huon
Aquaculture, Petuna and former Tasmanian salmon farmers regarding the risks to the marine
environment posed by current practices and/or regulations. Additionally, the program
addressed how scientific knowledge and data is used by different actors by highlighting the
inconsistency in the interpretation of both environmental data available and the impact of
salmon farming on the surrounding marine environment. However, the only scientific data
that was discussed on the program concerned a select incident of low dissolved oxygen in
Macquarie Harbour, giving little context of environmental process. This was presented by a 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
71
scientist from Melbourne University. Local scientists who worked directly with the Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture industry and regulators were notably absent from the program.
Conflict over science information was entrenched in the public debate over salmon farming in
Tasmania. This was exemplified in discussions regarding Tassalâ€™s latest proposal for a salmon
farm off the coast of King Island, in the North West of Tasmania, where a community meeting
was organised by opposition groups. These groups used crowd funding to engage what they
determined to be â€˜independentâ€™ scientists to conduct an environmental assessment of the
proposed farm, hoping it would indicate the area was environmentally unsuitable to farm
salmon. However, a concern was raised by the organiser and leader of the meeting that this
assessment could find that the location was in fact environmentally suitable. In response,
another opposition group leader suggested that regardless of what the outcome of the
assessment was they would oppose it because â€œthat doesnâ€™t mean the community has given
a licence to do it and that it is acceptableâ€ (Marine Protection Tasmania, 2017).
Science was portrayed in the Tasmanian public discourse of salmon aquaculture as something
that mattered alongside community and place, articulated in the script of an all-media
campaign featuring the CEO of Tassal:
I grew up in Tassie. My journeyâ€™s led me away and back again to this place and home I love.
All the things we hold near and dear: people, environment, science. What I love most about
our company is what Tassal brings our local communities. We love the fish. But it is really
about the people. (Tassal, n.d.)3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
72
The media campaign, rather than having the aim of directly selling Tassal products, sought to
attract the attention of the local audience in attempt to win back Tassalâ€™s social licence to
operate.
3.4 Beyond borders: Australia-Asia region as the transnational case of
trade
International trade can emphasise the disconnect between impact on local environments and
demands from distant markets (Steneck et al., 2011). What is considered important changes
across local and global environments, debates and markets. For example, seafood traders in
China view green labelling and concerns of environmental sustainability as less important
compared to other factors such as food safety (Fabinyi et al., 2017). The risk of continued
environmental impact can be considerable if this disconnect is not addressed through
effective governing mechanisms. Therefore, understanding how the interpretation of
environmental sustainability is modified transnationally is increasingly important to local and
global governance of internationally traded seafood.
The environmental sustainability of seafood is prevalent in transnational market-based
governance discourses involving governments, seafood harvesters and producers, ENGOs,
media actors and consumers (Barclay and Miller, 2018, Miller, 2014). Nevertheless, there are
limited theoretical literature and empirical case study examples to understand how
environmental concerns are conveyed transnationally in relation to media roles and
environmental campaigning. 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
73
3.4.1 Trade context in the Australia-Asia region
A focus on the Australia-Asia region is pertinent as Australia recognises the opportunity for
export of luxury export items (Fabinyi, 2007, Commonwealth of Australia, 2012). The
Australian Governmentâ€™s enthusiasm and commitment to these Asian export markets is
highlighted in reports such as the governmentâ€™s white paper, Australia in the Asian Century
(2012) and the subsequent 2013 white paper â€˜Tasmaniaâ€™s place in the Asian Centuryâ€™. The
reports stipulate the opportunity for luxury export items, as the Asian middle class is predicted
to grow to three billion Australian dollars by 2030 and have the largest population of high
income earners in the world within the next 20-30 years (Commonwealth of Australia, 2012).
From 2013 to 2017, Australian export increased by 40% from $1 billion to $1.4 billion, with
exports to China forming most of this growth (Fabinyi, 2007). The Tasmanian white paper
specifies â€œenabling the expansion of salmon aquaculture in Macquarie Harbour [a large inlet
on the west coast of Tasmania and the first area to farm salmon in Australia]â€ as one of the
key activities to build export strengths and sustainable development (Tasmanian Government,
2013: 43). However, this growth agenda was challenged when the University of Tasmaniaâ€™s
Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) was reported to have found salmon farming
to be responsible for â€œenvironmental collapseâ€ in Macquarie Harbour (Woodruff, 2017). This
was accompanied by increased media attention, local opposition and environmental
campaigning. Parallel to the local public debates (as described in earlier sections), export
revenue for salmon increased, with high-margin sales making China the most desirable
international market for Tasmanian producers. Tassalâ€™s annual export sales revenue climbed 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
74
by 238% to $44.1 million, while domestic revenue dropped by 2.8% to $400.6 million (Tassal,
2017). As noted earlier, at this time Tassal opened an office in Shanghai.
The tension between the economic growth and environmental impact of the salmon industry
in Tasmania is not expected to diminish. Seafood has been the fourth largest export for
Tasmania and international trade is reported to have increased by 27% in 2015, including a
doubling of sales to China (Tasmanian Government, 2017a). In 2015, Australia also signed free
trade agreements with Japan and China. As we enter the â€˜Asian Centuryâ€™, demand for
resources, market opportunities and changes to media and communications practices and
strategies is expected to intensify in the Australia-Asia region. Adjacent to this, rapid growth
in both seafood consumption and production, environmental effects and arising
environmental conflicts is expected in the Australia-Asia region (Cao et al., 2017). To
complement the existing scholarship on local sustainable seafood discourses within Asian
export countries (see Fabinyi, 2016), further examination of how local and global
environmental concerns of seafood production interact and flow in the Australia-Asia region
is required.
The Chinese seafood market (both production and consumption) is the largest in the world.
Chinese consumption patterns are likely to have the most influence in global fish markets into
the future with the region expected to account for 38% of the global consumption of food fish
by 2030 (World Bank, 2014). These consumption patterns are highly relevant to global
environmental outcomes. The scale of this consumption and trend in luxury species has been
directly linked to overfishing and stock declines in some fisheries (Cao et al., 2017, Fabinyi et
al., 2012). Rising demand for luxury seafood in China has initiated a â€œglobal blue gold rushâ€ 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
75
(Caplog Group, 2014). For example, in 2014, accessing the growing Chinese middle-class
consumer became easier and cheaper with the launch of â€˜Gfreshâ€™, an online marketplace
facilitating the import of seafood to China, directly linking business and consumer. In the
companyâ€™s first two years of operation, it is reported to have â€œprocessed more than $200
million worth of wholesale live seafood ordersâ€ (Kolodny, 2017). The platform notes origin,
species and quality of their catch.
China made up 65% of Australiaâ€™s total sales in 2017, an unusually high export year with 32%
increase from 2008 to 2018 (FRDC, 2018). Comparatively, Australia only made up 0.3% of
Chinaâ€™s Atlantic salmon imports in 2017, with 0.53% from 2008 to 2018. Additionally, there is
a growing discourse regarding Asian investment in Tasmanian salmon companies, the
strengthening vertical monopolies that are forming and possible implications for future food
security (Oâ€™Conner, 2018, MacDonald, 2018, Thompson, 2011b). In emphasising the
significance of the Chinese market for the Australian economy and the relative insignificance
of Australian product for China, these figures make clear the vulnerabilities of trade for
Australia. These trade vulnerabilities have been accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic
as China blocked imports, imposed new customs inspections and imposed considerable tariff
increases on Australian primary industry products. This was said to be China punishing
Australia for calling for an investigation by the World Health Organisation into the origins of
the COVID-19 virus in China (Niewenhuis, 2020). Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon were among the
Australian seafood products that were at risk of shipment delays into China leading to
commercial losses (Australian Government, 2020).3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
76
Australiaâ€™s trade relations with its Asian neighbours is a prominent agenda for governments
and industries. At the 2016 G20 meeting the then Australian Prime Minister, Malcom Turnbull,
is reported as stating: "It would be a mistake of historic proportions for the G20 to stand by
while scare campaigns not based on facts or evidence foster protectionism, or indeed
isolationism," (ABC news, 2016a). Turnbull reportedly stressed that â€œprotectionism, trying to
turn back the clock on economic reform, that is the road to povertyâ€ (ABC news, 2016a). In
other words, G20 leaders should ignore economic scaremongering and be aware of the risks
of opposition campaigning against efforts to strengthen trade relations, particularly with Asia.
The transnational reality of Tasmanian farmed salmon isthat it is not simply a locally produced
product which is sold domestically (i.e. with a simple, linear production and value chain).
Rather, the operating environment in which it is produced and sold is characterised by
international investment, local campaign messages reflecting international frames (Wood,
2017), exchange of expertise, technologies and products from overseas, and global
environmental sustainability certification (Rockcliff, 2017). The transnational flow of
personnel, investment, resources and information is expected to increase and congregate in
the Asian region. As Australiaâ€™s natural resources are put under pressure to supply the growing
middle class of Asia (Cao et al., 2017), Lester (2014) highlights the increasing relevance and
importance of the notions of â€˜locally affectedâ€™, â€˜distant awareâ€™ and â€˜global riskâ€™ in her
examination of transnational publics and environmental conflict in the Asian century. Lester
(2014) brings to attention the challenges and potential for regional conflict as competition for
natural resources increases in the Australia-Asia region:3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
77
If media and communications, community organisations and individuals (among others)
have crucial roles to play in developing Australiaâ€™s â€˜two-wayâ€™ links with Asia, these may only
rarely present a â€˜public diplomacyâ€™ stance that promoted the Australian government or
business communityâ€™s immediate interests. Instead, they will increasingly produce multi
directional and multi-layered flows of political communication and action in which distant
social networks join with those affected to resist development, end resource procurement
and undermine growth strategies. How Australian government and industry choose to
respond to and manage the economic and political impact of these protests and the still
poorly understood transnational communities of environmental concern that result will be
a crucial test of Australian claims to democratic and market leaderships among its regional
neighbours in the Asian Century. (Lester, 2014: 168)
Over the past decade, Tasmanian-based environment campaigners have cultivated strong
national and international networks from previous successful transnational campaigns
regarding the clearing of Tasmanian old growth forest for export into Asian Markets. These
campaigns targeted managers in Japanese corporations (using letters and reports) and were
successful in causing the corporations to discontinue contracts with Ta Ann Tasmania â€“
associated with the Malaysian company Ta Ann holdings (Lester, 2016b, 2019).
For transnational networks of ENGOs and grass roots lobby groups to influence the operations
of large transnational corporations, they mobilise support at various locations and distances
from the actual site of contention. This puts local issues on the political agenda of other
countries, thus turning local conflicts into transnational ones. Their influence on policy
formation should not be underestimated (Holzer, 2001). Given the export of Tasmanian
salmon into Asian markets is increasing, combined with Tasmaniaâ€™s notable history in 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
78
transnational environmental campaigning, the industry is positioned for local environmental
concerns to extend into Asian supply chains.
The link between Chinaâ€™s consumption patterns and impact on global fish stocks, combined
with Asiaâ€™s contribution to Australian trade, further highlights the importance of investigating
transnational flows of environmental concern (Fabinyi et al., 2017). With increased exports to
China and Chinese investment in the state, Tasmania provides a unique and critical
opportunity to explore what Lester (2014) describes as â€œmulti-directional and multi layeredâ€
links with Asia and â€œpoorly understood transnational communities of environmental concernâ€
and the responses they elicit.
3.5 International: Norway as the transnational case of information
flows
In response to this public scrutiny and politicisation of salmon aquaculture, a number of
studies have examined how such conflicts occur in the news media in a range of farming
regions (Amberg and Hall, 2010, Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017, ABC news, 2015a). Scholars
have also compared political and ecological growth challenges in farming countries (Young et
al., 2019). However, very little attention has been given to the transnational and international
flows of information regarding salmon aquaculture (see Bocking, 2012). This thesis examines
for the first time how environmental risk discourses compare and flow between Australia (a
relatively new salmon aquaculture industry experiencing expansion and conflict) and Norway
(a world founder and leader in salmon aquaculture for which the Tasmanian industry
emerged). This contributes to the knowledge of how the same industry can experience similar
or different trajectories, how environmental conflicts change depending on the age of
industry operations, different public spheres and levels of expansion. Olsen and Osmundsenâ€™s3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
79
(2017) media analysis highlight that perceptions of aquaculture and the associated
environmental risks might be influenced to a greater extent when these risks are associated
with global environmental discourses compared with actual or experienced reality at the site
of production. This aligns with Urkidi (2010) work which makes the connection between the
scaling-up strategy and glocalisation as strategic schemes to access political opportunities and
forces the opposition to engage in global oriented discourse. For example, the importance
placed on the localised environmental impacts of fin-fish aquaculture in international
discourses of global consumption of sustainable seafood (e.g. World Wide Fund for Nature,
2018) is promoted by â€˜supralocalâ€™ actors (those which transcend location or are associated
with more than one location).
Norway is the oldest and largest producer of farmed salmon globally and a world leader in the
globalisation of the international seafood market (Liu et al., 2016). Originating in the 1960s,
the foundations of the industry occurred in Norway and were supported by government in an
attempt to enhance the economies of regional fishing communities (FAO, 2012). After
biological and technical breakthroughs such as smolt rearing and feed, the industry
experienced considerable growth in the 1980s. Norway now produces 60% of the worldâ€™s
farmed Atlantic Salmon. Continued developments in production and management efficiencies
and global markets allowed the sector to become the large-scale commercial industry it is
today (Liu et al., 2016). The industry went from local small-scale farms producing 500 tonnes
in the early 1970s to large multi-national companies producing 1.2 million tonnes in 2018,
worth $64.5 billion (Norway Statistics, 2019) and constituting 70% of Norwayâ€™s seafood 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
80
exports. Aquaculture has grown at the highest rate of any sector of the Norwegian economy
with an average growth of 10% per annum over the past 50 years (Hersoug et al., 2019).
Of the 20 largest salmon aquaculture companies, 11 are headquartered in Norway (Berge,
2017). Mowi (formally Marine Harvest) has been the largest salmon farming company since
2000 with a global harvest volume of 354,700 tonnes in 2017, with 210,200 tonnes of this was
produced in Norway (Marine Harvest, 2018). Mowi also diverged from the rest of the
companies in 2014 when it challenged the adequacy of management approaches for
mitigating lice problems (Bailey and Eggereide, 2020).
The industry was initially characterised by a narrative of rural development and local
ownership. As production grew, issues with disease of farmed fish became prominent, leading
to the environmental degradation narrative in the late 1980s (FlÃ¸ysand and Jakobsen, 2017).
The increase in production and disease outbreak also caused product prices to fall. In
response, the government removed regulations that facilitated the locally owned and small
scale structure of the industry. While bigger companies began to dominate with large-scale
production and focused on forming a global industry, the industry and government continued
to promote the rural development narrative. As sustainability principles gained traction, the
narrative of global demand was promoted to allow the industry sector to maintain a growth
agenda while remaining legitimate within the sustainability discourse. This shifted the
narrative of local environmental impact to the nutritional needs of a global community. Here,
industry has a responsibility to supply food to a growing population.
The Norwegian government champions the aquaculture sectorâ€™s goal to grow to an industry
worth $100 billion by 2030 and five times that by 2050 (Hersoug, 2015, Norsk Industri, 2012). 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
81
Along with industry growth there has been increasing awareness and extensive media
coverage of both the positive impacts such as production of healthy food for a growing
population and negative impacts including the environmental externalities of such economic
pursuits (Liu et al., 2016). Over the past decade, the environmental risk narrative has prevailed
and negative framing of the industry has been prominent in public discourse (Young et al.,
2019).
Growth of the sector has flattened in recent years due to management decisions that
restricted expansion in response to concerns over struggles with sea lice infestations. In 2009,
the Norwegian government released the â€˜Strategy for an environmentally sustainable
Norwegian aquaculture industryâ€™ noting areas that identified where aquaculture practices
were likely to have a negative effect (Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs,
2009). In 2014, the government also released 45 â€˜greenâ€™ licences for the sector which required
licence holders to enhance technologies that reduced the environmental impact of salmon
aquaculture (FlÃ¸ysand and Jakobsen, 2017). Of these, 35 were â€˜light greenâ€™, requiring those
applying for the licences to develop improvements to the current open-net-pen technology.
The remaining 10 were â€˜dark greenâ€™, which required a discernible reduction in fish escapees
and less than 0.1 adult female sea louse per fish. â€˜Greening technologiesâ€™ that were trialled
and developed using these licences included land-based production systems, closed
containment systems, and offshore aquaculture operation systems (FlÃ¸ysand and Jakobsen,
2017). The announcement of these licences led to an increase in innovative technology
projects reinforcing the â€˜greeningâ€™ of the industry (Christiansen, 2017). 3 | Salmon aquaculture: The case study
82
The third-party certification programs also received criticisms from environmental campaigns.
A petition with 3,369 supporters run by Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture (GAAIA)
in 2011 was sent to WWF and the ASC, arguing that their collaboration with Mowi, the largest
and multinational salmon company, was contributing to corporate green-washing (Staniford,
2011). GAAIAâ€™s website states â€œWWF Norway even accepted blood money from the world's
largest salmon farming company (Mowi) in return for the panda stamp of approvalâ€ (GAAIA,
n.d.). In its mission statement, GAAIA opposes WWF and ASC, along with aquaculture
companies, exhibiting concerns that the â€œStandards for Responsible Aquacultureâ€ they
imposed are not stringent enough and â€œfail to address welfare and food safety issues and
allow for the use of toxic chemicals, antibiotics, unsustainable feed, escapes, non-native
species, GM feed and the killing of marine mammals.â€ There are also campaigns claiming that
the soy used in the fish feed is from unsustainable sources. For example, one of the prominent
concerns of environmental campaign organisations in Norway at the time of this research was
the use of soy in the feed to produce salmon was sourced from farms that had cleared
rainforest in Brazil (see Garberg et al., 2014). The fish feed industry transitioned to using soy
in response to concerns regarding the poor conversion ratio of fish input (to feed the salmon)
to the fish produced. Following further concerns about the providence of the soy, the fish feed
industry claimed to use certified products, proving that the soy did not come from the regions
of concern.Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology

RESEARCH APPROACH
AND METHODOLOGYChapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
84
4.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines the approach taken to answer the research questions and the overall
aim of the thesis as posed in Chapter 1. To understand how environmental risks are negotiated
via complex media and communications process, both locally and transnationally, a case study
approach is applied which draws on qualitative methods. This chapter explains the selection
of the case study, empirical material and discusses the approach and theoretical
underpinnings for data collection and analysis. The research combines content analysis with
critical discourse analysis of semi-structured in-depth expert interviews, news media text and
scholarly accounts of media analysis. This chapter also reflects on limitations, challenges and
quality of the research approach.
4.2 Research aim and question
The aim of this thesis is to inquire into how mediation of environmental conflict occurs and is
examined via the overarching research question: How are environmental risks of common pool
natural resource use articulated and negotiated locally and transnationally through processes
of media and communications? The research problem this study addresses is explained in
Chapter 1, and the theory, concepts and case context discussed in Chapters 2 and 3.
In the context of increasing pressure and conflict over natural resources, the overarching aim
of the thesis is to investigate and critically analyse how environmental risks are publicly
constructed and debated
4.3 Research approach and assumptions
Common throughout this study is the acceptance that making decisions regarding
environmental risk is political and therefore a subjective process. The relationship betweenChapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
85
mediated environmental conflict and the physical or tangible environmental outcomes
remains theoretical in this research. From this theoretical foundation the thesis explores the
implications of the communications strategies and mechanisms that different stakeholders
undertake and the presence and absence of competing claims for the governance of
environmental risk.
In qualitative research, the researcher is recognised as an active constructor of the research,
from framing research questions, data generation and analysis, to synthesis and
interpretation of findings. Interpretations of qualitative data are seen to be subjective and
partial with objectivity considered impossible. Therefore, researcher reflexivity is imperative
at every stage of the research process. Here, I reflect on the research process as a whole and
my ontological and epistemological underpinnings and assumptions. The intention here is not
to find a single truth, but rather open up the understandings and discussion on how we
negotiate environmental risk. This research engaged in three main undertakings:
1) Problematisation: where the researcher does not discover a problem, but rather the
problem is constructed. The researcher identifies something that is perplexing and
worth investigating further. In this thesis, I was intrigued by how different knowledges
and information were perceived and considered in environmental governance at
different scales and how this process was negotiated between and among different
stakeholders. This raised questions of legitimacy and power particularly in the
interaction between environmental campaigns, formal decision-making processes and
policy change, market mechanisms and scientific â€˜evidenceâ€™. What I found increasingly Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
86
perplexing is how the local and transnational interact in this context and to understand
what roles media play.
2) Empirical inquiry underpinned by theory: Grounded in existing ideas, concepts and
theories this thesis employs an empirical research approach in order to contribute to
and build on current knowledge. This empirical and theoretical work provides the basis
for developing context applicable implications and considerations for claims-makers
and decision-makers in environmental conflicts. From the empirical data, codes,
categories and themes are generated as a basis for a critical analysis of discourse.
3) Critical explanation of the problem: During the research, I presented my identified
problem, findings and insights to my supervisors, at multiple international conferences
spanning environmental communications and seafood governance and three papers
have been produced for publication in peer review journals. In doing so I have received
critical review of my research approach, empirical data gathering and analysis, and the
synthesis, interpretation and the meanings I make regarding the implications of the
research and its application. This critique has been consistent and enhanced my
constant evaluation and revaluation of my research at every step.
The local and transnational elements of environmental conflict is a complex system with
multiple feedback loops (rather than one-directional causal relationships), which requires
research that addresses these complexities. With the ambition of embracing complexity and
uncovering detailed descriptive and empirical accounts of public risk negotiations, power Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology

relations and interactions between knowledge information and institutions in the context of
environmental governance, the research utilises a case study approach. This generates
empirical data for analysis guided primarily by qualitative research methodologies. Such
investigations of complex social interactions are arguably more fruitful compared to other
more simplistic research approaches (Wolfe et al, 2013: 10).
Risk involves perception and individuals can interpret risk differently (Howes, 2005). Even if
individuals can come to the same definition of risk, they may rate the severity differently â€“ for
instance by scientists, politics, publics, corporations, NGOs and economists (Landy et al.,
1994). Realists take the view that risks are â€˜realâ€™ and can be identified and defined by science.
In this approach, divergence in risk perceptions can be attributed to lay person ignorance,
misinterpretation of expert information, or lack of data or uncertainties in the science.
However, the realist approach fails to adequately acknowledge the social context and the
norms and boundaries this creates for which risk is perceived and negotiated.
Because the research aims to examine how environmental risks are constructed publicly at
the discursive level, the focus of analysis is discourse. Here I draw on Dryzek (2013) to define
discourse as a â€œshared way of apprehending the world ... constructing meanings and
relationship and helping define common sense and legitimate knowledgeâ€. In this way, I do
not assume that impact to the physical environment is a given when producing seafood for
human consumption. If my ontological position (i.e. view about how the world works) is one
where environmental risk is not fixed but rather socially constructed, I require an
epistemological (i.e. idea about how we generate knowledge about the world) approach that
helps me investigate knowledge and information as a product of the social and political Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
88
context in which it was shaped. Departing from the positivist position of environmental
impact, I shift the focus of my analysis to how the risk of environmental impact is viewed and
produced as a topic of concern. I want to know how environmental risk emerges as an object
in the discourse and the tensions and resolutions in social interactions when negotiating this
object. This interest in discourse is based in post-structural discourse theory, a branch of
critical theory (Guba and Lincoln, 1994), whereby individuals assume different positions on a
given subject at different moments in space and time dependent on the discourses that they
are presented with and have access to (Davies, 2004). Here multiple discourses often conflict
while each try to dominate the others (Kress, 1985).
While post-structural theory deems knowledge as socially constructed, it does not reject the
existence of the physical world or the individuals in it, in contrast to what some critics suggest
(e.g. Quigley, 1999, Litfin, 1994, Irwin, 2001). Accused of neglecting a solution (Irwin, 2001), it
unapologetically pays attention to the construction of the problem and challenges the status
quo by considering a range of alternatives and therefore identifying multiple opportunities for
action, rather than one true and correct outcome. In fact, defining the problem and revealing
underlying interests is considered the first and most important step in conflict resolution
(Marcus et al., 2012), with wicked problems rarely being completely â€˜solvedâ€™. Moreover, socio
ecological issues are not binary, and post-structuralism allows the research to capture
complex and fluid ideas. For example, the term â€˜sustainabilityâ€™, â€˜environmentâ€™, â€˜developmentâ€™
and â€˜communityâ€™ are all interpreted and experienced differently by different individuals and
even likely to shift across space and time for individuals. Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
89
To uncover the complexity of environmental conflicts and governance, a qualitative approach
was taken in both data generation and analysis. Primary and secondary data were collected
including news media (Chapters 5 and 6) and peer reviewed scholarly accounts of local
mediated debates (Chapter 7) (secondary data) and interviews with stakeholders that had
expertise in the environmental governance and communications of salmon aquaculture and
seafood in Australia, Norway and Asia and on a global scale (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) (primary
data) (see below sections for more detail). Because the research aims to examine how
environmental risks are constructed publicly at the discursive level these data are analysed
using critical discourse analysis, underpinned by content analysis of news media and
literature.
4.4 Research Design
4.4.1 Case study
Applying this empirical qualitative research to a case allows for in-depth inquiry of a real-life
phenomenon within a specific context and provides valuable insight which can be applied to
other cases (Yin, 2014). The importance of the background context provided by a case study
is foregrounded by Wodak (2001) stating that analysis should take note of; â€œ1) the immediate,
language, or text-internal context; 2) the intertextual and interdiscursive relationship
between utterances, texts, genres, and discourses; 3) the extralinguistic social variables and
institutional frames of a specific â€œcontext of situationâ€; and 4) the broader socio-political and
historical context, which discursive practices are embedded in and related toâ€. It is suggested
that constantly moving between these perspectives for evaluation in a case study is one way
to minimise the risk of bias in the interpretation of results and lack of ability to generalise Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
90
broad implication, common criticisms of the case study approach (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Eliciting
generalisation for the broader society can be achieved by appropriate case selection (as is the
case in the natural sciences). Case studies also offer the opportunity to help explain or uncover
phenomena that are not readily understood by existing theory (Bradshaw and Wallace, 1991).
The approach provides the opportunity to produce practical knowledge supported by practical
experience, which is no less valuable than general theoretical knowledge that is independent
of context (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Comparison of cases allow researchers to better understand
special and temporal differences and expose contributing factors (Ragin and Zaret, 1983).
4.4.1.1
Case selection
When applying a transnational research agenda, many researchers advocate the importance
for foregrounding the local reality within global communications studies (Lester, 2016a, Kraidy
and Murphy, 2008). The research began at the local level by obtaining a detailed account of
the publicised environmental conflicts following key events in the expansion of salmon
aquaculture in Tasmania: the Senate Inquiry and the Four Corners episode. Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture provided a local context for which the research could expand from. These locally
contained debates (Chapter 5) were then placed within global environmental risk discourses
in the seafood industry (Chapter 6) and the international salmon aquaculture sector (Chapter
7). This approach contributes to critical understanding of how environmental risks are defined
within local and international communities and sustainability discourses flow and interact
transnationally.
The expansion of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania and Australiaâ€™s free trade agreements with
China and other Asian countries at the time of the research provided a timely and opportune Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
91
case to contextualise the theories and concepts of media roles and transnational
environmental campaigning in seafood governance in the Australia-Asia region (Chapter 7).
This Asia-based research provided insight into the largest export market for Tasmanian salmon
products. Additionally, the mediatised environmental conflicts observed in Tasmania and
Norway were drawn upon to investigate the extent to which environmental risks and
associated discourses are shared between nations that farm Atlantic salmon and what these
could tell up about the trajectory of the Tasmanian industry. Norway was chosen because it
is the oldest and largest producer of farmed salmon globally and a world leader in the
globalisation of the international seafood market (Liu et al., 2016) with early connection to
the foundations of the Tasmanian industry.
The case study provided current, visible and contentious environmental politics to investigate
three spheres of conflict and how they interact; 1) expansion at the site of salmon farming
causing regionally contained tensions and contested claims (Chapter 5); 2) how this is
transferred through export markets and supply chains (Chapter 6); and 3) how this tension is
manifested transnationally, forming a global community of concern (Chapters 6 and 7). The
case has high levels of general public interest, significance across local, national and global
spheres and is unique, all of which are key attributes essential for research (Yin, 2014).
4.5 Data collection and analysis
Thisresearch uses multiple methods of data collection, generation and analysisfor which each
are rigorous, valid and complete in their own right. The results from these individual methods
are then triangulated to form the overall research (Morse, 2003), described by Neuendorf
(2004:33) as a â€˜highly desirable situationâ€™. In doing so the strengths and weaknesses of eachChapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
92
method is compensated for by the other. Triangulation in research is considered to improve
validity of the results by assuring legitimacy and accuracy (Jick, 1979) and is defined by Denzin
(1970:297) as â€œthe combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenonâ€.
This thesis applies multiple approaches to collect and generate qualitative data: The following
methods were applied in this research:
1. Qualitative content, framing and critical discourse analysis of news texts that reference the
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture debates,
2. Critical discourse analysis of semi-structured interviews with key export stakeholders in the
case of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, Norwegian salmon aquaculture, Asia export
markets and international seafood discourses,
3.Direct observation of key events in the global seafood, Asian seafood trade, Australian
seafood and Norwegian salmon aquaculture were attended, and
4. Systematic literature review of scholarly accounts of news media representation of the
Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry debates.
The research includes a two-step analysis of interview and news media texts, using NVivo 11
software (QSR International), a software that allows for descriptive hierarchal coding of
prevalent concepts within qualitative data. The first step was a content analysis, which served
to highlight areas for further discourse analysis to â€œuncover the way reality is producedâ€
(Hardy et al., 2004: 19). Content analysis identifies the frequency of content making discourse
themes that are present in the text clear and quantifiable (Riffe et al., 2014). For this thesis,
both content analysis and critical discourse analysis are applied as a means of providing the Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
93
most breadth and depth for the research. The most notable limitations of, and threat to
reliable, qualitative research methods is the risk of â€œexcessive interpretation on the part of
the researcherâ€ and the risk of losing the richness of the original data by way of excessive
reduction (Elo and KyngÃ¤s, 2008: 114). It is not possible for any researcher to maintain
complete objectivity during their research and approach. Therefore, qualitative researchers
must acknowledge and interrogate their bias through reflection, triangulation of data and
combination of analytical methods. While both content analysis and discourse analysis rely on
the researcherâ€™s interpretation, each method provides something the other cannot. The
nature of content analysis assures that all units of data receive equal treatment (Sharp and
Richardson, 2001). The content analysis drives the discourse analysis in that it identifies areas
for further investigation.
In order to make a full assessment of the influence of media, Sima (2011) recommends media
based assessment of stakeholder activity be supplemented with interviews and/or
observation. Thus, while the media and textual analysis allows for examination into the claims
making and decision-making discourse in the public sphere and the outcomes of
environmental campaigning, the interviews and direct observation afford insight into how
these responses, outcomes and agendas are devised.
Wodak (2001) also suggests triangulation by way of using empirical data alongside background
information. Similarly, Kitzinger (2007) identifies the importance of context of an issue by
stating that researchers should start with â€œimmersing themselves in the media coverageâ€
supplemented by material such as that produced by campaign groups or discussing the issue
with key stakeholders. Additionally, triangulation in research is considered to improve validity Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
94
of the results by assuring legitimacy and accurate representation of the problem (Jick, 1979).
For example, Andersen (1993) argues that an analysis of an issue â€œbased purely on the content
of media coverage paints a rather one-sided pictureâ€ and suggeststhat this analysis should be
accompanied by interviews with the sources themselves as well as with media journalists.

4.5.1 Discourse analysis
Studying discourse is a common approach in media and communications fields (Peeples,
2015). There are various approaches to analyse these discourses and they all encompass
important assumptions regarding the relationship between social and political change.
Schiffrin et al. (2003: 1) explains there are three main categories that define discourse â€œ(1)
anything beyond the sentence, (2) language use, and (3) a broader range of social practice
that includes non-linguistic and nonspecific instances of languageâ€. There are varying degrees Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
95
of importance given to communication and institutional structures as factors for bringing on
social change (Sharp and Richardson, 2001).
Discourse approaches are generally referred to as either â€˜descriptiveâ€™ or â€˜criticalâ€™ (Gee, 2014:
8). A common approach to descriptive discourse analysis is content analysis which focuses on
the themes and issues raised in discourse. Critical discourse analysis applies and considers
concepts of social power (Van Dijk, 2001). This facilitates exploration of sociological avenues
where discourses are â€œmultiple and competing sets of ideasâ€ where relationships between
practices and institutions are acknowledged (Sharp and Richardson, 2001 :196). Discourses
function in a way that promote, make accessible or normalise certain ways of perceiving the
world. Analysis is critical because â€œno discourse can ever be neutral; it is always involved in
circulating and promoting one form of knowledge, of values, of ways of being and living over
another; it is involved therefore in promoting the interests of a particular social groupâ€
(Morgan, 1996b: 71). Critical discourse analysis was developed by Norman Fairclough, among
others, and focuses on how power flows and operates within society using language (see
Fairclough, 2013). This approach was applied to this research to understand the underlying
social dynamics and political realities of mediatised environmental risk negotiations. By doing
so, it places the data and results within societal context, with particular attention payed to
power to help understand how texts are produced and what they â€˜say about the society in
which it was produced forâ€™ and the impacts â€˜text may have on social relationsâ€™ (Richardson,
2007: 42). Critical discourse analysis is considered as â€œthe single most authoritative line of
research regarding the study of media discourseâ€ (Carvalho, 2008: 162).Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
96
This thesis applied discourse analysis to examine how environmental risks are constructed
publicly at the discursive level to answer the questions of salience of issues, trends and
patterns in media. The analysis techniques of discourse and content analysis are employed by
researchers to uncover the frames that are used to portray a particular issue. Content and
discourse analysis serve as the process underpinning the frame analysis (Kitzinger, 2007). How
risks are socially constructed is determined by how they are communicated in the public
sphere (Cottle, 1998). Framing is closely tied to agenda setting, however framing goes a step
further. The literature distinguishes between first and second levels of agenda setting where
1) first level agenda setting refers to what media tells the audience to think about â€“ what
topics are present or absent in the news, campaign, media release etc, and 2) second level
agenda setting (and framing theory) is how media frames the information in order to control
how the audience thinks about an issue.
Because the process of critical discourse analysis is detailed and time-consuming, such
research is often limited to a smaller sample (Machin and Mayr, 2012). Rather than collecting
texts over a long period of time, it is often the case that a detailed review is conducted of a
sample that is taken to represent a â€˜snapshotâ€™ in time (Carvalho, 2008: 173). These temporally
concentrated snapshots which see the exchange of power occur between actors or groups are
referred to by Carvalho (2005) as â€˜critical discourse momentsâ€™. Generally following key events
in the conflict timeline, they change the course of the conflict or reaffirm the existing
trajectory of the discourse. The concept of â€˜critical discourse momentsâ€™ identifies that there
are often specific events where the prevailing discourse is contested, multiple alternative
positions are generated and power challenged (Carvalho, 2005). By identifying critical Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
97
moments, rich analysis of the different value positions engaged in issues of debate and conflict
can be conducted.
In line with Patton (1987), this research undertook three key stages in data analysis; 1)
organise data; 2) reduce data into concepts/codes/categories; and 3) identify themes and
correlations in data. Descriptive coding was used to identify and categorise statements made
by interview participants and in media and textual documents. Hierarchal coding was
employed to assist with the interpretation and organisation of results. Open coding, the first
step in the coding process, identifying the major themes, was first applied to identify major
headings and subheadings. Axial coding, a process that relates codes to each other, looked
further into the nuances of these initial categories, exploring what causes or influences
categories and the relationships between them. As the coding process progressed coding and
analysis occurred simultaneously.
4.5.2 Application of discourse analysis
Both primary and secondary data were generated and collected in this research. Primary data
consisted of key informant interviews which complemented the collection of news media and
peer reviewed scholarly accounts of local mediatised debates. Table 4 outlines the different
data sets for which discourse analysis was applied that are presented in each results chapter. Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology

4.5.2.1
News text selection
To begin, I had to determine how to select the text for analysis. Challenges were already met
at this first task, considering that news texts are published and shared across multiple
platforms and often boundless in the global flow of information (Beck, 2011). Because of this,
research practice in the field of media and communications no longer accepts the
categorisation of â€˜traditionalâ€™ (print) vs â€˜newâ€™ (digital) because it fails to adequately represent
how audiences consume media (Beck, 2011, Couldry, 2012, Hepp and Couldry, 2009). I sought
advice from media and communication scholars, whom often used news text, as opposed to
spoken word and/or visual images on television, to reflect public discourse on environmental
issues (see Amberg and Hall, 2008, Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017, Feucht and Zander, 2017,
Bocking, 2012). Certainly, a key factor influencing this research was that historical records of
newspaper articles are much easier to access and analyse. The online news archives also
provide a reliable data source where it is clear what is, or is not, being archived. Continuing
this tradition, it was assumed in this research that the audience was the Australian public who
used news outlets with both print and digital platforms.
During the period of research design there was considerable spill-over of public debate into
social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter). Largely unmediated by journalistic norms and
practices, social media provided insight into the values, beliefs and interests of multiple
Australian publics. To capture these insights, I monitored content present on social media
between mid-2016 and early-2018. This included Twitter posts and Facebook pages of
opposition groups, salmon companies, science institutions and political representatives. This
shaped my understanding of the case and how it was portrayed across media by giving Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
100
background context to those with interests, information flows, power relations and provided
colour around the mechanisms and strategies for claims-making and their responses.
However, due to the limitations of collecting and downloading social media data, particularly
historical data (Stieglitz et al., 2018), formal analysis was not able to be conducted and
therefore data from social media as a data source is not included in this thesis. Furthermore,
Wodak and Meyer (2009) recommend using only one form of media in the analysis.
News articles were collected using the Factiva news database, claiming nearly 33,000 sources
of news globally (Dow Jones, 2018). Search words for both data sets were: â€œsalmon farmâ€ OR
â€œfish farmâ€ OR â€œsalmon aquacultureâ€ OR Tassal OR â€œHuon Aquacultureâ€ OR Petuna. Search
criteria also stipulated Australian sources. The timeframe for which articles were collected
was chosen with the aim of capturing media representations of critical moments in the
discourse. Hence, the six-month period following the Senate Inquiry (between 15 July 2015
and 15 January 2016) and the Four Corners episode â€˜Big Fishâ€™ (between 1 November 2016 and
1 May 2017) was chosen. More detail about these events is given in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5.
These time frames also ensured there was no overlap between the two events. Submissions
to the Senate Inquiry were invited on 24 March and due by June 1 and the Committeeâ€™s report
was submitted 21 August. While the proceedings of the Senate Inquiry spanned several
months, the public hearings were held on 15 and 16 of July and was used as the event date
for collecting news articles. The Four Corners dataset started the day after the show aired.
The top five news sites that published the most articles for both the Senate Inquiry and Four
Corners were: ABC News (14 and 49), Launceston Examiner (10 and 28), Burnie Advocate (21
and 37), Hobart Mercury (13 and 98) and The Australian (0 and 7) (Table 5). Other news outlets Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
101
which emerged from the key word searches primarily published financial information (e.g.
regular share price updates) and were excluded from the analysis. Also excluded were stories
concerning other fish farming operations around Australia. Subsequently, these five news
outlets were considered the most representative data sources for investigating the Tasmanian
salmon farming debate and articles published by these news outlets were included in the
analysis (Table 5). A total of 277 news articles were included in the analysis, split into two
corpus: the Senate Inquiry comprising of 58 news articles and Four Corners comprising of 219
news articles. This sample included opinion pieces as well as articles written by journalists.

The dataset provided by Factiva includes both articles written by journalists/news outlets and
opinion pieces submitted by any interested parties or the general public. Opinion pieces were
included in this data set because they are the outcome of news media practices and decisions
â€“ that is, they meet publishing criteria and are presented to readers as worthy of publication.
They are part of the package of information on salmon aquaculture that is presented to
readers. The information contained in the opinion pieces contributes to mediated reality and
public knowledge (Johnson-Cartee, 2005, Page et al., 1987). See also Olsen and Osmundsen
(2017) and Osmundsen and Olsen (2017).
For comparison, a study analysing the Norwegian salmon aquaculture debates included news
articles from 9 Norwegian newspapers with local, regional, and national audiences over 3
years from 2012-2014 comprised of 827 articles. If this sample were to include â€˜small notesâ€™
and debate contributions, making it more similar to the sample used in this thesis, the sample
would have been 1,304 articles. Considering the salmon aquaculture sector in Norway is the
largest and oldest in the world and covers a much larger spatial scale, population, industry
players, ENGOs, local and regional governments and research institutions, it would be
expected that the number of news articles published would be considerably greater than that Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
103
of the Tasmania salmon aquaculture industry. However, newspapers in this sample covering
the Tasmanian salmon debates produced 20% of this amount in a third of the time.
Considering the considerably smaller spatial scale and operating environment and number of
newspapers reporting on the Tasmanian salmon industry this sample is considered
comparable.
The Hobart Mercury and The Australian are both owned by News Corp Australia. The Hobart
Mercury covers Tasmaniaâ€™s south and claimsto reach 540,000 readers monthly across its print
and digital platforms and an average readership of 68,000 to 75,000 monthly readers
(weekends and weekdays respectively) (News Corp Australia, 2018b) with 73,000 followers on
Facebook and 16,000 followers on Twitter at the time of writing. The Australian is the
Murdoch flagship paper and Australiaâ€™s only general newspaper with a national news
coverage. The paper is said to have a monthly reach of 4.4 million readers across its print and
digital platforms with an average monthly readership of between 430,00 and 470,000
(weekdays and weekends respectively) (News Corp Australia, 2018a) with 907,000 followers
on Facebook and 735,000 on Twitter. The Burnie Advocate and the Launceston Examiner are
both owned by Fairfax Regional Media. The Advocate focuses on news from the North-West
and West of Tasmania, claiming a combined print and digital monthly readership of 171,000
(Fairfax Media, 2018a) with 180,000 followers on Facebook and 6,000 on Twitter. The
Examiner covers northern Tasmania, claiming a combined print and digital monthly readership
of 315,000 (Fairfax Media, 2018b) with 61,000 following on Facebook and 14,000 followers
on Twitter Historically, the three Tasmanian newspapers have had one of the highest
penetration rates into local homes and remain important within these readership figures, Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
104
undoubtedly inflated compared with the populations in their respective readership areas. The
ABC uses a variety of platforms including television, online and radio. For the purposes of
analysis, news published online was collected. The ABC claims that in the 2016-2017 financial
year, average monthly reach of ABC Online was 7.7 million, (ABC, 2017b). The national ABC
Facebook page has just over 4.2 million followers with the ABC Hobart page having 160,000
followers. The national ABC Twitter page has 14 million followers with the ABC Hobart page
having 14,800 followers.
4.5.2.2
News text analysis
Following data collection, individual files were uploaded into NVivo 11. A thematic analytical
approach, seen as a foundation method for qualitative data analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006),
was applied to this research. I conducted an initial content analysis on both data sets in which
codes and categories were identified. This initial high-level quantitative count of themes was
undertaken to help lay the foundation for critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 2013). The
approach to identifying and defining codes and categories was conducted in a way that
ensured the research question was answered. This process consisted of familiarisation with
the data, from initial codes relationships between codes identified to form themes which were
then reviewed, compared and when necessary redefined.
The first step involved the coding of the presence of stakeholder groups and discourse themes
within articles. All mentions were noted, not only those in which stakeholders were directly
quoted. This aimed to capture how visible stakeholder groups were, compared to how active
some were. This aimed to uncover any stakeholder groups that might have been visible but
not actively engaged in public debate. The number of articles that mentioned a theme or Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
105
stakeholder were counted, rather than the frequency that the theme or stakeholder was
mentioned throughout the dataset.
Once this initial content analysis was conducted, the second step involved a deeper discourse
analysis, for which I refer to Hajer and Versteeg (2005: 175) whereby discourse is â€œan
ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which meaning is given to social and
physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of
practicesâ€. Environmental politics and concepts such as sustainable development â€œare
continuously contested in a struggle about their meaning, interpretation and
implementationâ€ (Hajer and Versteeg (2005: 176). By unpacking the â€œkey language, rules,
norms and values and assumptionsâ€ the analysis can focus on the sources of the problem
rather than the symptoms (Fleming et al., 2018: 24). Here discourse analysis serves to better
understand the mechanisms and meanings behind environmental discussions regarding
complex socio-ecological interactions.
Both data sets following the Senate Inquiry and Four Corners episode are compared in Chapter
5 with a more in-depth look at the competing discourses following the Four Corners episode
in Chapter 6. The analysis underpinning Chapter 7 coded specifically for anything that related
to the transnational nature of the industry.
The option of using computer aided discourse analysis was trialled with the software program
Leximancer. The program conducts a content analysis and identifies a linier relationship
between themes identified. However, this did not add any depth or nuance to the
understanding of the research question in focus. I also felt a distance from the raw data
compared to the understanding I obtained when I was immersed in the analysis. The program Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
106
allowed the level of detail in the themes to be changed. This was useful to gain an
understanding of the text, and the outputs were helpful in testing and confirming the content
analysis that had been conducted. The software could also be useful in other instances where:
visual representation of the data is important, large amounts of textual data must be analysed
within very short time frames, to identify changes over time and to test analysis conducted by
the researcher. However, it was felt that the analysis in Leximancer did not add anything to
the analysis contained in this thesis and therefore has not been included.
4.5.2.3
Interviewing
Interviewing is a well-established and recognised qualitative research method in the social
sciences (Flick et al., 2004, Berger, 2016, Deacon et al., 2007, Yin, 2016), particularly in studies
using multiple methods of data collection (Bryman, 2006). Interviews provide rich personal
experience that other data sources cannot often generate, if requiring interpretation by the
researcher. They have been used extensively in the field of media and communications and
environmental studies (e.g.Bourk et al., 2017, Lester and Hutchins, 2009, Schweizer et al.,
2013). While there is an array of approaches and techniques, the act of interviewing is
described as â€œa conversation between a researcher (someone who wishes to gain information
about a subject) and an informant (someone who presumably has information of interest on
the subject)â€ (Berger, 2016: 191). Interviews can be undertaken either with the intent of
gathering very structured precise information or to generate a rich description and an in
depth understanding of how the informant experiences a phenomenon (the qualitative
interview). â€œThe purpose of the qualitative research interview is to contribute to a body of
knowledge that is conceptual and theoretical and is based on the meanings that life Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
107
experiences hold for the interviewees.â€ (Warren and Karner, 2005: 314). Whilst providing a
richness of personal experience that other data sources cannot often generate, this approach
leaves much of the interpretation to the researcher. Thus, triangulation is important to
consider in the research design and researcher reflexivity is required when conducting the
research. The level of interpretation depends on the type of interview conducted, ranging
from structured to unstructured. The semi-structured in-depth interview is the most
commonly and widely employed interviewing format and was used to provide depth and
context to the textual data (DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree, 2006, Britten, 1995). This format of
interviewing was chosen due to the level of detail in the data they produce, compared with a
structured survey format. This is especially important when comparing language and attitudes
of different groups and actors within the issue. Nonetheless, it is important when interviewing
to constantly reflect that there is no single truth and that a rounded understanding of an issue
comes from the learnings from many interviews and other sources of information that lends
to the construction of knowledge (Deacon et al., 2007).
In the case study approach, interviewees are selected based on their involvement in the case
and are often identified using snowballing techniques guided by the principle of saturation.
This helps to ensure that the most suitable and appropriate participants are identified, and
several interviews are conducted. Snowballing refers to a practice where interviewees are
asked if they know of anyone they think would be appropriate and willing to be interviewed
(Ezzy, 2002). Saturation is achieved when no new ideas or concepts emerge from the data
(e.g.Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Hence, more data generation does not equal more information
or shed more light on the issue being investigated (Mason, 2010). How quickly saturation is Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
108
achieved, and therefore the sample size, can be determined by a range of factors including
(but not limited to) the scope of the study and interview, the number of special interest
groups, homogeneity of the sample, method of data collection (i.e. interviewing technique
chosen), whether interviewing is one of multiple data collection methods, level of expertise
of participants and position within the case, time and resources available (Lee et al., 2002,
Ritchie et al., 2003, Jette et al., 2003). Because qualitative research is about making meaning,
frequencies are less important compared to quantitative research. It only takes one
occurrence of a code to be included in the research and its sole occurrence is potentially just
as useful in uncovering processes within the research problem. The concept of saturation is
debated (Dey, 1999, Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Strauss and Corbin argue that as researchers
familiarise themselves with the data there is always potential to find something new.
Therefore, I take Strauss and Corbinâ€™s (1998: 136) recommendation that saturation should be
concerned with identifying the point where generating more data becomes â€œcounter
productiveâ€ and that anything new that is discovered does not contribute to understanding
the overall research problem. Ultimately, the aim of the research is the main determinant of
the study design and therefore the sample size (Charmaz, 2006).
Because qualitative research is laborious and time consuming, samples are often much smaller
compared to that of quantitative research. If the sample is too large the analysis becomes
repetitive and unnecessary. Nevertheless, interviewing a large range of stakeholders ensures
the qualitative data is representative of the topic providing reliable data (Francis et al.,
2010). Identifying participants can either be done in a purposive or non-purposive manner.
While purposive sampling for interview participants within the stakeholder groups raises Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
109
issues of bias, this is mitigated if the sample is representative (Tongco, 2007). This also
ensures critical actors in the case are interviewed. With this in mind, enough data samples
must be collected to ensure most, if not all, perspectives that are critical to understanding the
research problem are uncovered.
The aim of this thesis was to gain insight from expert stakeholders. Data was collected from
one-on-one interviews rather than workshops because organising key stakeholders in
contentious issues to participate in a focus group or group interview is problematic. The issues
relating to salmon aquaculture are potentially contentious and politically charged. Because
this thesis sought to gain unobstructed in-depth insights from a range of expert stakeholders
involved in a contentious issue, group interviews or focus groups were not appropriate and
individual interviews were chosen for this research.
4.5.2.4
Application of semi-structured interviews
The interview questions were open-ended in order to facilitate and promote discussion
regarding complex matters and probe into the underlying and potentially previously
unidentified attributes to the conflict. This was particularly useful given the highly
contested nature of the issue. Additionally, at the end of the interview participants were
asked if they had any further comments allowing them to address any issues they perceived
as relevant to the topic that were not covered during the interview.
Non-random purposeful sampling was used for selecting knowledgeable and experienced
interview participants from a range of backgrounds including government, science, industry,
ENGOs, international trade, global seafood governance and journalism across local and global
scales in order to obtain insight into local and transnational flows of mediatised environmental Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
110
conflict. These participants were identified partly by the media analysis and partly through the
snowball sampling technique, guided by the principle of saturation, to ensure the full extent
of the social and political conditions were captured. Interviewees from the same organisation
were not interviewed unless it was thought that they could provide considerably different
insights to avoid duplication and unrepresentative saturation.
A total of 34 interviews were conducted in this study with stakeholders who were considered
to be key informants and experts in their respective fields and selected based on their ability
to provided expert insight into the environmental conflicts regarding the Tasmanian and
Norwegian salmon industry, the global seafood operating environment and sustainability
discourses, Asian export markets, Chinese media and environmental campaigning, Australia
Asia trade relations, international media reporting on the seafood industry, environmental
science and science communication and third-party environmental certification (Table 6).

The broad cross section of influential and knowledgeable positions of interviewees provided
opportunity for in-depth analysis of concepts and a source of triangulation of results from the
textual analysis. The interviews covered topics of local and transnational flows of information
regarding seafood sustainability. Interviewees detailed how they perceived the overall Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
112
operating environment of the public debates and their understanding of environmental
campaigning, media and environmental governance. Interviews aimed to obtain the
informantsâ€™ understanding and perceptions regarding the environmental conflicts of salmon
farming and seafood more broadly where appropriate, how participants gathered information
to form their perceptions, and their communication mechanisms and strategies. They also
sought to map and understand interactions between key stakeholders. In particular, the
interviews explored the claims-making and decision-making processes of ENGOs, seafood
companies, government regulators, media and journalism, environmental campaigning, and
the interactions this elicits between these actor groups. This was done in local and
transnational contexts. The extent to which these either draw upon or contribute to
transnational messaging regarding environmental impacts of seafood production was
considered. The implications of these networks and conflict discourses for environmental
governance at the local and regional level was also explored.
The potential interviewees were contacted via email which included an information sheet and
consent form. This procedure and all associated research was in accordance with the
University of Tasmania Human Research Ethics Committee (Social Science, Ethics Ref No:
H0014669) which encompassed the broader Australian Research Council project
â€˜Transnational Environmental Campaigns in the Australia Asia Regionâ€™. The introductory email
gave the participants an opportunity to decide if they were both willing and knowledgeable
enough to participate in the subject area. Interviewees remain anonymous. All interviews
were conducted in person apart from one which was conducted online via Skype. Interviews
were conducted from mid-2017 to early 2018 and each interview went for between 45 Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
113
minutes to two hours. While a predetermined set of questions provided structure to the
interviews, additional lines of discussion raised by the interviewee were pursued if relevant.
The interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcriptions were
provided to the respective interviewees for approval and the opportunity to make any
changes. No participants made any significant changes. After transcription, all the interviews
were read for data familiarisation. Initial codes were generated and relationships between
codes identified. Codes were constantly reviewed, coding hierarchies rearranged and when
necessary redefined.
4.5.2.5
Direct observation
In addition to the core data collection and analysis, key events in the global seafood, Asian
seafood trade, Australian seafood and Norwegian salmon aquaculture were attended. Direct
observation of key industry and trade events provided insight into the operating environment
and the current state of affairs, ideas, technology, interactions, policy and governance in
Norway and Asia. Important context was gained and attendance helped to ensure the
research was asking relevant and timely questions. This also provided confidence that the
research was placed appropriately within overall issues of seafood trade, sustainability,
politics, consumption and stakeholder relations and communications (Table 7). Travelling to
China and Norway and conducting the research myself provided me with first-hand
experience of the places that I write about. Attending seafood industry events in Norway and
Hong Kong and interacting with many people across the global and Australia-Asia supply chain
provided a vivid understanding of the operational setting to the research. Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology

Systematic peer-reviewed literature
The aim of the systematic review was to collate and synthesise literature which documented
media analysis of social conflict regarding environmental risks of salmon aquaculture in
Norway and compare the mediatised environmental conflicts. The literature that presented
media analysis were identified by searching the Scopus database using the search â€œNorway
AND salmon OR Aquaculture AND discourse OR narrative OR media OR communication OR
conflict OR governance OR managementâ€ in Abstract, Title or Key Words (N=411) and limited
to social science research (N=76). The literature search was current as of 1 August 2020. All
papers published prior to this date were included in the review. At this stage titles and
abstracts were read to ensure their relevance. Those that did not conduct a media analysis
regarding Atlantic salmon aquaculture were removed. The remaining papers (N=6) were then
read in full to understand how it related to mediated environmental conflict in Norway.
The focus was to identify and collate articles that were specific to how environmental conflicts
were negotiated in the mainstream media. However, articles which produced knowledge
regarding the broader operating environment for which these mediated discourses occurred
were also reviewed to provide context to the study.Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology

Application of systematic literature review: A comparative
analysis
A comparative analysis of the mediatised environmental conflict of the Tasmanian and
Norwegian salmon aquaculture industries is undertaken in Chapter 7. To do this the research
activities included:
1) Media analysis of themes and stakeholder groups addressed in news text concerning
the Tasmanian salmon industries,
2) Synthesis of academic peer reviewed articles that present a thematic media analysis
of the Norwegian salmon industries,
3) Comparison of the themes identified between the two case study farming regions and
presence of stakeholder groups in the news content, and
4) Interviews in both case study farming regions to test, verify and expand the findings
of the comparisons made between the media analyses presented in this thesis and
the synthesis of academic peer reviewed articles. Interviews were conducted with
expert stakeholders from industry, media, government, ENGOs, third-party
certification and science organisations.
Results were compiled into thematic tables emphasising three main dimensions:
environmental risk framing, key stakeholder groups present in mediated discourse, and
communication strategies of stakeholder groups.
This research intended on obtaining an understanding of the communication and media
practices, conflict attributes, and claims-making and decision-making processes, both locally
in Australia and Norway and transnationally. Similarities and differences regarding these
elements in the two countries were explored in order to contribute to the understanding of Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
119
mediatised environment conflicts regarding salmon aquaculture across local and global
contexts. The communications and media techniques and strategies were assessed to identify
areas of learning that could be applied to current and future environmental conflicts over
common pool resource use.
4.5.2.8
Limitations
Comparing different sets of media analysis presented in different research papers has
inherent limitations in producing conclusive findings regarding discourse nuances. Different
papers will have different research questions and approaches to qualitative coding and collect
data during different times. Additionally, very few studies have looked specifically at how and
by whom environmental risks are represented in news media regarding the Norwegian
industry, providing a small sample of literature to review. These limitations mean that the
analysis and conclusions from this part of the study (Chapter 7) should be read as indicative
rather than absolute. However, it does serve a purpose to provide a broad overview of how
the same industry can experience similarities and differences across world production
regions. It makes an argument for understanding industry trajectory in different growing
regions and transnational flows of corporate and campaigning practice, information, and
knowledge.
Asking questions regarding transnational flows requires new approaches to how we
understand the world. It is easy to retreat to the local, providing neat boundaries and context.
However, this is not possible if one seeks to explore transnational flows of ideas and
resources. Waisbord (2016: 869) refers to â€œacademic globalisationâ€, inviting the exchange of
knowledge and understanding across geographical boundaries with particular reference to
the field of communication becoming progressively globalised in recent decades. Waisbord Chapter 4 | Research approach and methodology
120
draws on Livingstoneâ€™s (2007: 274) observation that, â€œif internationalisation means
exchanging knowledge and understanding across borders, then we would probably all sign up
to it, confident that national approaches or concerns could find their place within this larger
forumâ€. Global translation of academic knowledge expands the collection of findings and
arguments with regard to particular empirical and theoretical queries, for example news
framing.
Both Tasmania and Norway share China as a major export market and are responding to
similar global trade conditions and demands. It is necessary to understand these comparisons
in an increasingly transnational world. Interviews provided depth and triangulation to the
literature review and together provided a useful approach to understand the differences and
similarities in the two countryâ€™s discourses and the transnational flow of information. 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates

5.1 Introduction
This chapter develops an in-depth understanding of how news media might help emphasise,
explain, exacerbate or help resolve deliberative processes within the context of the
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry conflict. Leith et al. (2014b) acknowledge the
usefulness of deliberative processes to link science, societal values and decision-making. One
of their industry interview participants noted the importance of finding pathways that
mitigate vicious cycles of conflict when they stated that â€œwe canâ€™t just be meeting in the media
â€¦ there has to be a process, and we are just starting that processâ€ (Leith et al., 2014b: 289).
These â€œprocessesâ€ include narratives around engagement and research projects mapping
public values of waterways. The Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry experienced
heightened environmental conflict in which media played more than a neutral role â€“ that is,
the conflicts were both mediated and experienced the impacts of mediatisation.
To assess how environmental risks of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania were framed and
negotiated in the public sphere (Habermas, 1991), this chapter identifies and analyses the
narratives presented in news media discourse following the formal Senate Inquiry and the
more informal journalistic mode of inquiry presented in the Four Corners program into
aquaculture governance. By focusing on how Tasmanian salmon aquaculture was presented
in regional and national news media, this study sheds light on the relationship between public
knowledge and policy formation. This chapter seeks to understand the role media play in
public negotiations of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture by a) identifying and analysing
dominant themes and stakeholders within news media coverage, particularly where disputed
and ambiguous social and scientific information appears; and b) considering how associated 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
123
media practices and logics might influence outcomes of complex common pool natural
resource-use conflicts.
5.2 Overview of news media attention
The number of news articles identified in this study was 268% greater following the Four
Corners program compared to that of the Senate Inquiry (Figure 5). This increase was most
obvious in The Hobart Mercury.

Advocate, ABC News and The Australian newspapers. Source; Factiva.
5.3 Stakeholder visibility, conflict and framing following two critical
moments in the public debate
The analysis identified key stakeholder groups present in the mediated discourse following
the Senate Inquiry and Four Corners program (Figure 6). The most prominent stakeholders
that were mentioned in the news media across both events were salmon companies,
government regulators and politics and science institutions. Local ENGOs and emergent local
opposition groups became visible following Four Corners. 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
124
Stakeholders mentioned in news media following Four Corners and the Senate Inquiry
respectively included salmon aquaculture companies (Tassal 60% and 46%, Huon Aquaculture
42% and 36%, and Petuna 17% and 27%), government and political actors (59% and 31%%),
scientists/science institutions (23% and 17%), Tasmanian-based ENGOs (18% and 3%),
emergent local opposition groups (11% and 5%), third-party certification organisations (10%
and 14%) and community members (7% and 3%).
Figure 6: Frequency of key stakeholders mentioned in the news articles following the Senate Inquiry and Four
Corners program
The Tasmanian salmon industry was commonly referred to as one entity (Figure 7). According
to news reports, the industry embraced the Senate Inquiry as an opportunity to â€œshowcaseâ€
the industry, showing confidence that the industry would come out of it stronger and
â€œwelcome[ed] the Inquiryâ€™s focus on transparency around waterway healthâ€ (Blucher, 2015b).
Both Tasmanian Liberal and Labor political parties opposed the Senate Inquiry, with the
leader of the Labor party opposition, Bryan Green, explaining that the industry underwent 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
125
rigorous monitoring regimes and politicising the issue would diminish public confidence in the
salmon industry (Smiley, 2015). The resistance from political parties for the Inquiry into the
industry may have promoted the lack of trust in regulatory processes instigated by Huon
Aquaculture and expressed through news media, broadcast television and radio, social media
and legal proceedings evident following Four Corners.

following the Senate Inquiry. Dashed arrows indicate negative relationships and solid arrows indicate positive
relationships. Boxed stakeholders and the size of the box (approximately) indicate the number of news
articles they are mentioned in. No box indicates a lower presence.
Compared to the relatively contained social network present in news media following the
Senate Inquiry, the Four Corners program expanded the number of actors present in news
media and revealed unexpected coalitions and alliances between stakeholders (Figure 8). This
created more complexity in the conflict relative to that of the Senate Inquiry. Most notably,
Four Corners publicly highlighted a shift in industry cohesiveness. The division among industry
in Tasmania was brought to the fore in Four Corners, which explicitly identified claims of
industry corruption and environmental degradation.5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates

127
From publicly acting and being perceived publicly as one unit, variances developed in
individual companyâ€™s communications and how they were being portrayed and perceived in
the public sphere. News media following Four Corners displayed negative perceptions toward
Tassal. Whereas Huon Aquaculture appeared to be publicly forming positive relationships
with local ENGOs (although it comes at the cost of a negative relationship with the World
Wide Fund for Nature). The public adversity towards Tassal also experienced input from a
greater number of actors following Four Corners. This was instigated by the Four Corners
program itself but also related to Tassalâ€™s expansion on the East Coast which instigated the
formation of local opposition groups. The industry division was not only carried through news
media, but also social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook with posts indicating a
preference to purchase Huon products or an adversity to purchasing from Tassal. An ethical
investment firm was also persuaded by ENGOs to halt investment in Tassal.
Along with increased complexity of actor networks and associated claims-making, news
coverage following Four Corners was characterised, and complexity reinforced, by conflict
compared with that of the Senate Inquiry. In news coverage, this was represented through
the following: word choice in stories about Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal action, portrayed
hostility between and among key stakeholder groups; the use of words such as attack,
divisive, extremist, hot topic, conflict and squabbling; accusations of double standards and use
of misinformation; and through claims that key actors were not engaging outside of media.
Reinforcing the presence of conflict, actors in media identified the need for collaborative,
rational and respectful discourse.
Editorials began to address and highlight the conflict present in the discourse and suggested
methods for resolution. In its editorial, â€˜The power of compromiseâ€™, the Hobart Mercury 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
128
acknowledged the importance the salmon aquaculture industry plays in the Tasmanian
economy and calls for greater leadership and unity of the salmon industry by learning from
previous environmental failings. This begins with meaningful public engagement â€œbeyond
meaningless press releasesâ€:
The Mercuryâ€™s position is straightforward. Aquaculture is vital for the future of the stateâ€™s
economy. Absolutely vital. We want to see it do well. It creates desperately needed jobs at
a time when unemployment and under-employment remain among our greatest blights.
But it needs to be sustainable and we make no apologies for shining a light on when this
may have failed. The debacle that Macquarie Harbour is fast becoming cannot be allowed
to persist. We must learn from this, be honest in our assessment and put in place measures
that ensure it is resolved and never happens again. And the industry needs to move beyond
meaningless press releases and background briefings and genuinely build internal bridges.
Without a unified front, it will be complicit in its own demise. The heads of all companies
need to sit around a table, put whatever differences they have aside and agree on a path
forward. Extreme sides â€” mired in cheap shots and offering information that is either
incredibly biased or completely wrong â€” do nothing to advance either position.
Aquaculture represents a genuine opportunity for Tasmania â€” an opportunity to build
something together as a state. A line in the sand needs to be drawn. Leadership needs to
be shown. (Hobart Mercury, 2017)
Similarly, also in an article in the Hobart Mercury following Four Corners, the then
sustainability manager of Tassal acknowledged that â€œvigorous debate is healthyâ€ while
â€œunproductive conflictâ€¦is damaging for everyoneâ€ (Thomas-Wilson, 2017).
The conflict within the sector was further amplified by the apparent, traditionally unlikely,
alliance between Huon Aquaculture and Environment Tasmania, self-described as: â€œthe peak 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
129
group for environment organisations in the stateâ€¦[a] campaigning organisation best known
for leading the alliance that stopped the Super Trawler Margiris from fishing in Australian
waters, and for our part in the Tasmanian Forest Agreementâ€ (Environment Tasmania,
2016a). It could be construed that by publicly supporting Huon Aquaculture for its efforts to
reduce the environmental impacts of salmon farming, Environment Tasmania was claiming to
have created a partnership to achieve better environmental performance. However, the same
ENGO discredited rather than supported Tassalâ€™s efforts to mitigate environmental impacts
and to improve the industry standard for transparency and accountability in environmental
reporting in the companyâ€™s annual sustainability reports. Furthermore, Environment
Tasmania also carried the discourse prompted by Four Corners concerning the credibility of
the global conservation ENGO World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and its partnership with
Tassal into news media. This discourse was framed as corruption by Environment Tasmania,
which circulated a petition calling for WWF to halt the partnership.
The results indicate that the Four Corners program prompted heightened visibility of
Environment Tasmania within news media. This could reinforce the symbiotic relationship
between NGOs and journalists (Bownas, 2017, Konishi, 2017, LÃ¼ck et al., 2016). However,
supporting Powersâ€™ (2015) findings, the ENGOsâ€™ presence in media was still not as prevalent
as corporate and political representatives, or even science. These results indicate that these
critical moments in the discourse were not solely a result of environmental campaigns, which
have historically played a significant role in environmental discourse in Tasmania (see Cullen
Knox et al., 2017b, Murphy-Gregory, 2017, Lester, 2016b). Rather, in the case of salmon
aquaculture, Environment Tasmania was shown to leverage these critical moments for its
own strategic purposes. This is not to say that these campaigning organisations did not 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
130
provided a solid grounding for corporate players to use the environmental discourse as a
legitimate source of concern. However, it exemplifies a shift in the traditional role of ENGOs
in holding industries and governments to account, with an industry player adopting this role.
Both the Senate Inquiry and the Four Corners program led to a proliferation of different
framings of the salmon industry (Table 9). Four Corners was noticeable in shifting perceptions
of salmon companies with Tassal portrayed negatively and Huon Aquaculture portrayed
positively. The legitimacy of external third-party certification was also brought into question. 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates

5.3.1 Absence of scientists in media discourse
The Senate Inquiry played a notable role in introducing the role of science â€“ if not scientists
themselves â€“ in news media, primarily presenting science as a problem solver and an integral
component in informing corporate and political environmental decision-making. Following
the Senate Inquiry, 25% of the news articles and 40% following the Four Corners program
mentioned environmental science in a general capacity, such as the role of science in
informing the management of the Tasmanian salmon industry or excerpts from scientific
reports. However, only 7% and 2% of articles respectively featured scientists themselves.
Following the Senate Inquiry, four scientists were present in news media (two IMAS scientists
(one quoted) and environmental scientists from Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne universities
(all quoted)). Only three Tasmanian scientists â€“ including two marine scientists (one quoted)
and one political scientist (quoted) â€“ and one environmental scientist from Melbourne (quote
was taken from Four Corners) were present in the news coverage following Four Corners. This
could be considered a very low presence of scientists as actors in media coverage considering
the relatively high attention given to scientific reports and the debate over scientific
information and its role in environmental governance (Figure 9).5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates

5.4 Themes present in the news media following two critical
moments in the public debate
Analysis of news articles in the six months following the Senate Inquiry (Table 10 and Figure
10) and Four Corners â€˜Big Fishâ€™ episode (Table 11 and Figure 10) revealed the following
dominant themes: environment (56% and 61%) and expansion and growth (53% and 54%%),
government regulation (29% and 44%), community interests (34% and 41%), environmental
science (27% and 40%), economic prosperity (53% and 34%), sustainability (31% and 29%),
transparency (20% and 26%), and legal action (0% and 24%).5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates

5.5 Discursive themes arising in interviews
The interviews with expert stakeholders in the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry,
governance and environmental campaigning provided further understanding of these
themes, providing insight on, for example, the communication of science, perceptions of
transparency between stakeholders and outwardly to interested members of the public, and
how media roles are perceived in public debate (Table 12). Excerpts and more detail from
interviews are included in the following sections to provide depth and context to the media
analysis.

5.5.1 Environmental impact
The Senate Inquiry played a notable role in raising concerns of environmental impacts in the
news media with the protection, management and importance of the environment
dominating news media coverage following the Four Corners program. Environmental
concerns included impact on the benthic environment, dissolved oxygen depletion, farmed
fish health and mortality rates, surrounding marine life and animal welfare and surrounding
world heritage areas. For example, following the Senate Inquiry the discourse exhibited a
focus on the management of Macquarie Harbour in relation to the low dissolved oxygen and
impact on the benthic habitat. The discourse regarding the environmental impact on
Macquarie Harbour, first present in the Senate Inquiry, was carried by the Four Corners
program and further reinforced as a news issue by Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal proceedings. The
environmental impacts that were observed in Macquarie Harbour resulted in Tassal forfeiting
Aquaculture Stewardship Certification (ASC) certification for one of its leases closest to a
world heritage site, the EPA reducing stocking limits and Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal action
which claimed inadequate regulation of the harbour.
Concerns of environmental impact were closely related to the industryâ€™s expansion
(particularly in Macquarie Harbour and Tasselâ€™s proposal for Okehampton Bay) and the
importance of considering environmental risk in decision-making processes. Concerns 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
138
regarding environmental impact of the industryâ€™s expansion were responded to by companies
by promoting awards and certification received for their efforts toward environmental
sustainability. Tassal and government actors also responded to concerns of environmental
impact by asserting that opposition groups and Four Cornersjournalists were misrepresenting
the extent of environmental impacts of salmon production. It was reported that the State
Government â€œtook aimâ€ at a local environmental group (O'Connor, 2017) and "debunk[ed]"
claims from "green groups" that the Okehampton Bay site would not be sustainableâ€ (Inglis,
2017b).
5.5.2 Adequacy of the regulation of industry expansion
The Senate Inquiry instigated formal public debate concerning the adequacy of the
environmental regulatory process of the industry. Those opposing salmon farming in
Tasmania raised concerns regarding the independence of the regulatory process. These
claims were grounded in the perception that the government regulatory body at the time was
both the proponent and regulator of the industry. As one of the Senate Inquiry committee
members reportedly stated there was a "community perception" of potential conflict of
interest in the same bureaucracy being the industry's "regulator and proponent" (Blucher,
2015a). In response to concerns identified from the Senate Inquiry regarding the State
Government being both the regulator and proponent of the industry the regulatory power
for the environment was transferred from the Marine Farming Branch of DPIPWE to the EPA
mid-2016.
The regulation of the industry became a more prominent theme following Four Corners, with
Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal case and claims from opposition groups promoting debate
concerning the adequacy of the regulatory process in Tasmania to mitigate environmental 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
139
impacts of aquaculture. Industry and government actors addressed these concerns by noting
the high environmental standards and practices of the Tasmanian salmon industry, both in
the local and global context, by asserting that regulation rests on the input of independent
and quality science and promoting third-party certification of the industry. However, the
perceived regulatory and environmental failings of the management of salmon farming in
Macquarie Harbour gave grounds for parts of the Tasmanian community to question whether
government and industry, and the environmental science that informed their decision
making, could ensure that industry expansion (particularly Tassalâ€™s proposed Okehampton
Bay site) would not pose unacceptable environmental risk:
One of the stateâ€™s three big salmon producers, Huon Aquaculture, told last nightâ€™s Four
Corners program it believed a potential disaster was looming in Macquarie Harbour where
the industry had expanded in recent yearsâ€¦ The program also highlighted community
interests about Tassalâ€™s proposal to farm salmon at Okehampton Bay on the east coast.
(ABC News, 2016b)1
This was framed by an interviewee as leading to a loss of trust:
I genuinely feel the planning process is one of the big ones that let us down. Not helped by
the fact that Macquarie Harbor did go pear shaped and people have lost trust. So, the idea
of saying to people, "We've got a planning process," is not very reassuring to anyone these
days. (Interviewee 11)
Huon Aquaculture was reported to argue that regulatory measures were lagging:
1 Note regarding referencing: The author by-line is used when provided. In the absence of the author byline the
news organisation is provided for referencing purposes.5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
140
â€œWe are saying to the government: â€˜Weâ€™ve set the bar, you catch upâ€™,â€ said Huon co-founder
Frances Bender. â€œIt has to be comparable (to worldâ€™s best practice) because if it isnâ€™t â€¦
theyâ€™ll be too many of us, too close together, weâ€™ll get our fish sick, seals will get in â€¦ and
we just start over again.â€ Ms Bender said Huonâ€™s proposals had met with â€œsilenceâ€ from the
Hodgman government. (Denholm, 2016)
Additionally, while Tassal was seen to promote the quality of government regulations, the
CEO also promoted an additional â€œindustry funded watchdogâ€ when he stated: "We know we
have the best regulations in the worldâ€¦The best way to prove that is to be adequately policed
and that information being transparently produced." (Bevin et al., 2017). This also addressed
the concerns of independence of the regulatory process:
Primary Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff has denied the $700 million industry is not
regulated strongly enough, and told ABC 936 Hobart he was disappointed in the way the
industry was portrayed [in the Four Corners Episode]â€¦Mr Rockliff said the Government had
strengthened the industry's regulatory regime. â€œWeâ€™ve made enormous inroads to ensure
there is a far better arm's length process," he said. "Now the Environment Protection
Authority is in charge of the entire supply chain when it comes to regulating salmon, we've
actually also strengthened the penalties for those that breach the feed cap or the nitrogen
cap. (Bevin et al., 2017)
With fragments of information provided in media regarding these regulatory changes there
was a notable lack of information regarding how and why these changes were decided. 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
141
5.5.2.1The role of environmental science in formal regulatory processes
Science institutions and environmental science were most mentioned in articles that also
mentioned formal regulatory processes. This portrayed a strong correlation between the two
in the public sphere. However, no clear information was provided regarding this relationship:
Government stakeholders used science information to support their claims of â€œgood
regulationâ€ and was the group that most used science to â€œdebunk claimsâ€, in this case
claims of â€œgreen groupsâ€. (Inglis, 2017b)
We [the government in power] have always said we will be guided by the science and I now
call on those opposed to this proposal to abide by the independent umpireâ€™s decision.
(Lohberger and Richards, 2017)
Similarly, an interviewee emphasised the link between community interests and science and
the ambiguity regarding how these were considered in the regulatory process:
You can come up with science measures but I think people actually want to see how do we
relate that to the things that they care about, and how do we prioritise that?...Where in the
planning process is the community? That is where [scientists] started doing a lot more of
trying to relate the science to what people value. (Interviewee 11)
Concern was also raised by a range of interview participants that the collection of more
detailed environmental data was suggested only in order to appease community concerns
rather than deliver environmental outcomes. One interviewee explained that this use of
science can reduce the capacity for conversations to address the science being conducted and
the subsequent results and recommendations, referred to as the â€œreal scienceâ€:
I have talked to some of [those opposed to a new salmon farm], "We just don't want a
marine farm there. Visually we don't want one there." Well, that is fine, that is a reason for 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
142
not having one, it's a valid argument. Government were doing the same on the other side
of the coin, everyone just kept using the science, but really, I do not think â€¦ we actually
never got to speak about the real science. (Interviewee 3)
While science information and science institutions were frequently mentioned in news media,
in interviews scientists appeared to be reluctant to contribute to the deliberations over risk
definition in media â€“ as one interviewee noted, because â€œthese debates â€¦ tend to be politicalâ€
(Interviewee 11). While environmental scientists could explain the implications that different
farming regimes were likely to have on the environment and the risk of these occurring,
â€œacceptability is a political decision, because that is a social decision about what they are
prepared to tolerateâ€ (Interviewee 11). This means there were instances where government
decision-making did not align with science recommendations due to political reasons
(Interviewee 2).
5.5.2.2
Transparency of science information, formal decision processes
and the role of media
How science information was being represented and by whom was called into question in
interviews and news articles. The ownership and transparency of environmental science, and
how this information was used in regulatory decision-making and to support claims was
debated among salmon aquaculture companies, environmental groups and political parties.
In news articles Huon Aquaculture and representatives from the Greens political party
rendered the public release of scientific findings as a key accountability mechanism for
government decision-making, while also emphasising the ownership of scientific information
and power relations: 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
143
The company's [Huon Aquaculture] executive director Frances Bender said she was
"pleading" with EPA director Wes Ford to release IMAS' findings to the public. "I don't see
how you can interpret no oxygen at the bottom of the harbour and the fauna in the
sediments being deceased, as being anything [else]," Mrs Bender said. (Inglis, 2017c)
There is information out there, there are scientists conducting scientific studies now, there
have been numerous over the last five years especially since the expansion...but all that
science goes into the black hole that is DPIPWE said [Mr Wish-Wilson]. (Blucher, 2015b)
Notable was the absence of a rebuttal or information detailing government processes
regarding public release of scientific information. How to legitimately communicate science
information was highlighted when an interviewee stated:
There has been no independent authoritative voices to talk to the science publicly since this
issue began. We have not seen â€¦ scientists â€¦ talking publicly about their findings. [Salmon
aquaculture companies] cannot talk about it because then people say, "It's your science."
If government had to talk about it, and they largely do not, and do not know how to explain
it, then there is a perce[ption] of government and industry colluding to either not release
the science, or to influence the appearance of science, or assuming that it's not good
science. It's just a really easy way to knock out reality from a campaigning perspective.
(Interviewee 14)
During interviews, opposition groups expressed concern that companies and the government
were not disclosing information in a timely or useful format that allowed for other interested
stakeholders to make informed judgements (Interviewee 10). One interviewee explained the
difference between information provision and trust in that information, depicting the
difficulty of communicating scientific information:5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
144
This is where the media fits in quite a lotâ€¦Everybody says, "We want transparency, we want
to see the data," and I have tried in many of the environmental groups to see, "Do you really
want to see the data? Is that what you are saying? â€¦ or do you want to feel that you can
trust the output information that you are getting?" I think it's the latter. So, a lot of stuff
around transparency and easy access. I think the government has taken that on board and
said, "Okay, we are going to put everything on our websites." What they have not done is
really improve the mechanism in which you find it. So, it's all there now, everything, you
know? In most cases information goes up very quickly and the reports still go up, but they
are still 400-page reports. (Interviewee 11)
Salmon aquaculture companies and government primarily used websites to make large
amounts of information public. While this information was available it also needed to be
promoted in order to inform public debate. As one interviewee explained:
[Environmental monitoring programs are] just not promoted. The amount of water quality
monitoring they did for years before and after [the instalment of the Okehampton Bay
farm]. But I do not know whether they did not promote it properly or the public did not
want to listen to it. So, there is a lot being done that I do not think the public realise.
(Interviewee 3)
While a perceived increase in transparency over the past decade was thought to have made
claims-making more accurate and accountable (Interviewee 1), interviewees also suggested
that very few people were accessing or trusting this information.
While transparency of scientific information was a prominent communications theme in the
conflict discourse, there remains considerable uncertainty among interviewees regarding
transparency of science information and whose role it was to communicate science
information:5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
145
I certainly think that the science, the actual science could be represented better and more
clearlyâ€¦ now, is that up to the companies? Is it up to government? How do you do that?
[the company] want to farm there, it's not [the scientists] job to provide science that
supports what they are doing.â€ (Interviewee 3)
5.5.3 Community interests
Community interests were given similar visibility as environmental science in news media.
Community interests in articles took the form of community meetings regarding industry
operations, economic benefits for regional communities, and the connection between
adequate and transparent scientific information and increased community confidence in
decision-making. Community interests regarding Tassalâ€™s proposed expansion in Okehampton
Bay were also frequent in the sample. The importance of community support was commonly
noted, highlighting that community interests were an important consideration for the
industry and its management. Opposition to the Okehampton Bay proposal focused on
potential environmental impact and impact on the aesthetics of the region.
Community members were most mentioned in article where expansion of the industry was
discussed. An opinion piece in The Examiner highlighted community interest in the
environmental regulation of industry expansion and the lack of trust that regulation would
remain stringent in its absence:
In recognition of growing community interest in the regulation of the salmon industry, we
believe the Okehampton lease should be subject to the most stringent environmental
regulations and oversight,â€ Ms White [opposition party leader] told the media. Surely thatâ€™s
already the job of the stateâ€™s Environmental Protection Agency? At least one would hope
so. (Anonymous opinion, 2017)5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
146
Community confidence was linked to stringent environmental monitoring and transparency
of these measures. The Government was strong in their support for the expansion of the
industry promoting the industry for its â€œworld classâ€ environmental regulations and the
significance in the stateâ€™s economic prosperity:
Premier Will Hodgman said Tasmanians could be proud of the stateâ€™s world-class salmon
industry. â€œThe Government has recently updated environmental regulations for salmon
farming to make sure the community can continue to have confidence in the industry,â€ Mr
Hodgman said. â€œWe have also made changes to the Marine Farming Planning Act will help
to ensure environmental regulations keep pace with industry expansion.â€ The Tasmanian
salmon industry is worth $500 million, with the State Government aiming to expand it to
$1 billion by 2030. (Howard, 2016)
5.5.4 Conflation of environmental science and community interest
Environmental science and community interests were conflated following Four Corners within
the prominent themes of environmental risk of industry expansion and the adequacy of
government regulation. Building â€œpublic confidenceâ€ was said to rely on the interaction
between science and government process:
The decision [to deem Oakhampton Bay suitable for farming] has sparked predictable
reactions. Primary Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff said it â€œdebunks false claims made by
green groups around the suitability of the siteâ€. The Greens and Environment Tasmania
have derided the decision as a foregone conclusion. But at some point, the community
needs to be able to trust the science at hand and there is no reason we can find at this point
to doubt the findings of the review panel. However, this is very much a test case for the
future of the industry. Not only for how it operates but for how it can cultivate public
confidence well into the future. Given the amount of fog that has clouded the issue in recent 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
147
times, it is not a test the key players, the Government, nor the science, can afford to fail.
(Editor, 2017)
5.6 Economic prosperity
While environmental impact and risk was the prominent concern regarding the sectorâ€™s
expansion, the most prominent claim to support the expansion of the industry was the
economic prosperity it provided to the state of Tasmania. Local government representatives
discredited campaigns opposing industry expansion by stating they did not represent factions
of local communities that in fact welcomed employment opportunities. Nonetheless,
proponents of the â€˜pro jobsâ€™ narrative acknowledged the need for sustainable development,
highlighting the differences in interpretations of sustainable development. This reveals the
jobs versus environment narrative that was dominant in the expansion discourse:
A rally of 150 salmon industry workers and family members gathered on Parliament House
lawns on Wednesday to hear those employed in aquaculture speak of its importance to
regional communities. The rally was in reaction to a campaign, Let's Grow Tasmania's
Future, against Tassal's proposal to farm 800,000 salmon at Okehampton Bay. (Maloney,
2017)
With 5200 jobs in the industry, fish cannot be allowed to replace forestry as the
environmental battleground in this state. (Anonymous opinion, 2016)
The Tasmanian Government has given Australia's largest salmon producer, Tassal,
permission to build a new farm at Okehampton Bay on Tasmania's east coast. The decision
is dividing opinion in the local community, with some people welcoming the jobs that will
be created; while others are worried about the impact that salmon farming will have on the
environment. (Ogilvie, 2017)5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
148
The struggle between the economic prosperity and environmental preservation agendas was
embodied by what appeared to be a space for negotiation at the interface between
environmental science, government and salmon aquaculture companies:
Tassal's proposed salmon farm on the East Coast may have been approved, but the fiery
conversation it has provoked shows no sign of dying downâ€¦ While the [Marine Farm
Planning Review] Panel deemed the Okehampton Bay site suitable for salmon farming, it
also suggested further environmental surveys of the site be undertaken. Primary Industries
Minister Jeremy Rockliff, who commissioned the report, said the panel's findings were a
boon for Tasmanian jobs and industry. "[The government] values the science," he said. "We
want this industry to grow, and grow sustainably." Mr Rockliff also noted that further data
on the site would "give the community confidence" as the industry moves forward. (Inglis,
2017a)
A council on Tasmania's east coast has approved an application for seafood giant Tassal to
expand salmon production into the area, amid calls it should have waited for an Inquiry's
findings on the environmental impactâ€¦ Mayor Michael Kent last night said the proposal â€”
which includes a 200-metre-long jetty â€” would create much-needed jobs for locals in
nearby Triabunna. "We must take the opportunities â€¦ particularly where jobs can come
into it". Cr Kent said. (ABC News, 2016c)
Support for economic growth as the overriding concern was not unequivocal. This was
reflected in the statement of the Mayor of Glamorgan Spring Bay Council who, while generally
supportive of Tassalâ€™s expansion into Okehampton Bay, was reported as stating: â€œI donâ€™t
necessarily mean jobs at all costs, but we need to evaluate how many jobs are involved, we
think 25â€ (ABC News, 2016c). Here, the economic argument tried to find its place within the
â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ discourse and was seen to quantify the clash between economic and 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
149
environmental agendas identifying the level of environmental risk that was acceptable for the
level of economic prosperity.
Within news media, the concept of sustainability was often used ambiguously in sweeping
statements with no clear reference to the environmental, economic or social elements of
sustainability. This was exemplified when it was reported in The Mercury that the legal action
Huon Aquaculture was taking against the government regulator â€œwas about protecting jobs
by ensuring the harbour was sustainably farmedâ€ (Humphries, 2017). Here the reader would
need to assume that Huonâ€™s Ms Bender was referring to the environmental sustainability of
farming. When sustainability was explicitly defined it was often environmental sustainability
that was specified. This also depicted a narrative in news media that environmental
sustainability underpinned and provided the foundation for sustainable growth and provision
of jobs, rather than being valuable on its own. Government and industry stakeholders were
seen to promote the narrative of sustainable growth and at times acknowledged that this
should align with social licence and community concerns, but references to social
sustainability beyond these considerations were lacking.
5.7 Chapter summary
This chapter expands both empirical and theoretical understanding of how media influences
public debate through representations of claims-makers and decision-makers, and of their
claims, under differing modes of public inquiry â€“ the Senate Inquiry and Four Corners
program. In particular, the chapter contributes to the understanding regarding â€˜visibilityâ€™
(Lester, 2011) of stakeholders and how different stakeholders do, or do not, engage as
political actors. The analysis of these investigations, and the interactions and responses in
news coverage that they facilitate and promote, also asks what implications these claims-5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
150
making and discourse-shaping processes have for accountability and transparency in public
policy and management of environmental resources. Given the dominance of the
environment-at-risk discourse and the acknowledgement and use of scientific information in
claims and counter-claims by non-experts, the lack of participation by scientists themselves
in the mediated debate following Four Corners is a discernible gap. Also, the traditional role
of ENGOs in holding industries and Governments to account has shifted in this case to an
industry player (Huon Aquaculture).
Concerns such as lack of transparency, poor regulation and environmental impact that were
evident in Leith et al.â€™s (2014) work were still prevalent at the time of conducting this
research. This can inform processes of risk framing and potential opportunities for mediatised
conflict resolution between state and non-state stakeholders. It builds on Leith et al.â€™s (2014)
work which acknowledge the usefulness of deliberative processes to link science, societal
values and decision-making. It helps inform pathways for virtuous cycles by better
understanding how science, societal values and decision-making are negotiated in news
media. While Leith et al.â€™s (2014) research focuses on how science can better inform decision
making, the findings presented in this chapter emphasise the outward communications of this
process. In particular, it illustrates how acceptable environmental risk and impact is
determined in government decision-making processes.
The chapter finds that what is considered acceptable environmental risk of expansion has
been determined without adequate transparency of processes. The perceived lack of
engagement by government and industry decision-makers and transparency of decision
making processes have reinforced the distrust in environmental management and the
knowledge production institutions and processes that inform them (vicious cycle). 5 | Media representations of Tasmanian salmon debates
151
Considerable uncertainty still exists regarding whose role and responsibility it is to publicly
communicate environmental risks identified by science and what is an acceptable level of risk.
This chapter suggests that, in the case of environmental risk conflicts, it is worthwhile
determining the nuances of science communication in the public sphere where the discourse
over what is acceptable risk is carried out. Particularly in the transparency debate in
mediatised environmental conflicts of aquaculture. If we consider that how mediatised
environmental conflict unfolds is determined by the power dynamics between activists,
journalists, industry and politics (Hutchins and Lester, 2015), the findings in this chapter
suggest that modern media are playing a different role now in the mediation of scientific
information in public sector decision-making. Select scientists are given voice and because of
the contestation that this evokes, scientists become more reluctant to take up those limited
opportunities for voice. How science information is communicated within environmental risk
discourses of seafood industry expansion should consider the potential for, and risks of,
scientists becoming political actors. 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region

6.1 Introduction
This chapter places localised tensions regarding the environmental impacts of salmon
aquaculture within transnational environmental sustainability debates concerning seafood
production and vice versa. It focuses on the Australia-Asia region with Australia providing the
nuanced case study and Asia, particularly China, providing transnational context as Australiaâ€™s
largest export market for Atlantic salmon products.
The aim of this chapter is to gain an understanding of how the construct of environmental
risk and sustainability of seafood flows transnationally in the Australia-Asia region. The
analysis identifies how environmental sustainability is defined and negotiated, who is
involved and what mechanisms are used. To do this I ask:
1) What are the perceptions of environmentally sustainable seafood production within an
international community and which actors portray these perceptions?
2) How do these perceptions influence local debates of environmentally sustainable
production of seafood?
3) How do local issues influence international discourse regarding the environmental
sustainability seafood?
6.2 Overview of news representation and interviews
The analysis of interviews (Table 13) and news text (Table 14) revealed how different actors
determined, and used information to support this determination, whether the industry was
or was not meeting international environmental standards for farming salmon. Not only was
there a disconnect between international standards and how they are expected to be applied
locally, but also how different markets interpret environmental sustainability and what that
might mean for local operations. Third-party certification was used by industry as a 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
154
benchmark for environmentally sustainable practices and as a means of managing the risk of
environmental campaigning. However, discrepancies in what is considered acceptable
environmental impact between local ENGOs and third-party certification schemes were
observed in the research.

Asia, particularly China, is a growing market for Tasmanian farmed salmon. Australian
branding and environmental third-party certification indicate to the Chinese consumer that
the food is safe, rather than environmentally sustainable. This indicates a gap between local
debates at the site of production in Tasmania and the values of international markets. The
operating environment for media and ENGOs in China is also considered more restricted than
that of Australia. Nonetheless, Chinese ENGOs were observed to be campaigning against
selling of Australian products. It was also understood that ENGOs are proficient at facilitating
transnational networks and discourse while industry is still gaining momentum at the global
level. Industry considered some ENGOs to be a source of support at the global level of
discourse regarding environmental sustainability.
6.3 Transnational relationships between and among ENGOs and
supply chain actors
The results of the interviews indicated a shift in the relationship between ENGOs and
international seafood supply chain actors. Interviewees operating in a transnational capacity
in industry, ENGOs, media, retail and third-party certification reported that the degree of 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
156
collaboration currently observed in relationships between some ENGOs and seafood
businesses is vastly different to the mostly hostile relationships between business or industry
and NGOs historically. As one interviewee noted, now â€œwe act together, we discuss problems,
the NGOs start to understand what is our problem and we start to listen to their problemsâ€
(Asia-based interviewee 25). Similarly, Transnational interviewee 17 highlighted that:
Campaigns against salmon farming have shifted from making kind of global unbacked claims
to being very well documented claims. (Transnational interviewee 17)
However, it was also acknowledged in the interviews that historically, environmental claims
regarding unacceptable environmental impact of harvesting or producing seafood,
highlighted in transnational campaigns by global ENGOs, were not always being challenged
by the seafood industry with the same efficacy at the global level as ENGO campaigns:
The way [the industry] was segmented nationally, internationally or transnationally, was
very peculiar in that there was not always a voice that could address the concerns that were
being made on a global scale. (Transnational interviewee 17)
Further highlighting the global scale of environmental discourse, industry representatives
noted that ENGOs have been putting pressure on companies to be responsible for their entire
value chain, emphasising the necessity for global environmental standards and transnational
networking mechanisms that facilitate such expansive yet robust process. However,
Transnational interviewee 19 addressed the presence of alternative opinions between and
among stakeholder groups regarding how to best improve or meet environmentally
sustainable practices through the value chain â€“ namely whether it is most effective to be an
active participant in a supply chain that could have practices that are considered
unsustainable to help improve it or simply to not use those products.6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
157
The interviews indicated that managing the commercial risk of environmental campaigning
has been an important driver over the past two decades for the global seafood industry to
accept and embrace the concept of environmental sustainability. A representative of a
prominent Asian retailer identified in interview that the company determined procurement
risk areas by using ENGOs, media content and customer surveys as the major sources of
information. The interviewee particularly noted that the retailer did not address scientific
information in this decision-making process. If during this monitoring process conflict was
identified to be present regarding a product they stocked, the retailer would send someone
from headquarters to local suppliers in an attempt to solve the problem (Asia-based
interviewee 25). This interviewee also noted that in response to ENGOs asking retailers to
initiate environmental discourses through the supply chain, seminar-type events were set up
to instigate information sharing with key stakeholders, such as government, companies and
ENGOs in the supplying country. When asked why these retailers work closely with ENGOs
the interviewees noted three key reasons; 1) to understand the ideas and thinking of the
ENGOs in order to manage the risk of environmental campaigning, 2) to utilise the ENGOs
expertise and international networks and, 3) ENGOs provide technical expertise on matters
that span international governance boundaries.
A comparable example provided by interviewees was that of Southern Bluefin Tuna, which
was produced in Australia and sold in the Asian market with third party environmental
certification. In 2017, a major e-commerce platform in Asia, JD.com, posted a photo on social
media of a Southern Bluefin Tuna promoting the Australian supplier. In response, a group of
Chinese ENGOs campaigned in the Chinese media for JD.com to stop selling the fish based on
its International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN) critically endangered status. Even 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
158
though this fish holds the â€œFriends of the Seaâ€ certification, JD.com ceased selling the tuna
within three days of the campaign. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) was criticised for
its partnership with JD.com. Similar to the Tasmanian salmon debate, dialogue between the
ENGO and industry was reported to have been limited at best, with all communications
occurring via media platforms (Asia-based interviewee 27). While â€œFriends of the Seaâ€ serves
as a different certification process to Aquaculture Stewardship Certification (ASC), they both
advocate for environmentally sustainable seafood and portray this sentiment to consumers.
This example reinforces the finding that communication between local and international
actors was absent and certification did not, in this instance, provide protection against
criticism regarding seafood production practices. This example encompasses a similar set of
actors to the salmon case study, but directly operating across the Australia-Asia region (Asian
based and international ENGOs, Australian seafood producers and exporters, global
environmental third-party certification schemes, and Chinese media). These actors also
appear to disagree about was is the acceptable environmental impact of seafood production
activities, providing a precedent for conflict between ENGOs and certification schemes to
occur in the trade of seafood from Australia into Asia markets.
6.4 The extent to which global discourses are used in local claims
making
Local industry and government actors have used global references in the Tasmanian
newspapers by promoting third-party certification of the industry and the implementation of
what they claimed to be â€œworld classâ€ environmental practices and standards (Rockcliff,
2017). As a rebuttal, local ENGOs promoted international scientific literature and details of
international fin-fish farming practices to assess nuances of the meaning of â€œworld classâ€
standards. For example, it was claimed in the Hobart Mercury:6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
159
If you look around the world, it is clear that the future for aquaculture is either land based
or properly offshoreâ€¦ Other salmon farming countries like Norway and Canada have arrived
at the same conclusion. (Wood, 2017)
Additionally, the ramifications that local industry practices can have on distant environments
and societies was acknowledged in the interviews. For example, if a local company shuts
down, retailers must then source the product from elsewhere in the world that may have
lower standards or regulatory rigour. Those in support of the industry explained:
If our salmon industry goes by the wayside, the gap will be filled, and the jobs will be taken,
by producers in Asia or South America. (Walton, 2017)
These potentially undesirable repercussion of extremist approaches on industry and the
environment has meant that â€œwe need to be really, really careful that we do things very,
very well hereâ€. (Tasmania-based interviewee 8)
Using international materials to underpin local claims is instilling the notion of a â€˜transnational
community of concernâ€™ (Lester, 2014), giving grass-roots groups a form of legitimacy. Here,
local actors use global discourse to strengthen local claims. However, the results also indicate
there was little connection between local and international perceptions of the Tasmanian
salmon industry. For instance, it was perceived among portions of the Tasmanian public that
industry and government processes lacked transparency, particularly those associated with
Tassal (Whitson, 2017). However, a Tasmanian newspaper highlighted that internationally,
Tassal had been applauded for its transparency:
TASMANIAN salmon producer Tassal Limited has achieved another sustainability honour,
this time on the world stage. ASX-listed Tassal was named as the worldâ€™s top seafood 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
160
company for sustainability reporting and transparency in a report rating the top 100
seafood companies on various measures. (Ford, 2015)
Tasmanian-based interviewee 9 highlighted that while Tassal focused on undertaking
initiatives of environmental sustainability and transparency that were recognised
internationally, namely ASC certification, the company had overlooked the need to engage
and promote these initiatives locally early on in its expansion.
The disconnect between local environmental campaigning and global third-party certification
schemes regarding the perception of the processes and implementation of certification has
created confusion for industry concerning what is deemed â€œgood enoughâ€¦what is
sustainable, what does sustainability mean?â€ (Tasmania-based interviewee 8) and what
mechanisms to determine and practice environmental sustainability are considered
legitimate to both the consumer, ENGOs and third-party certifiers. This highlights
disagreement and conflict over interpretation of fact (e.g. whether something is transparent),
which can be based on different sources of information, values and priorities driving how that
information is perceived.
6.5 Third party certification as a mechanism of transnational flow of
information regarding environmental sustainability of seafood
production
Seafood buyers acknowledged third-party certification schemes were useful tools to help
identify seafood that is more likely to align with their purchasing policies (Asia-based
interviewee 25). However, a range of interviewees highlighted that global third-party
certification schemes for environmental sustainability were still undergoing improvements
and identified that the relationship between certification and environmental sustainability
was strained. One transnational interviewee (18) depicted some of the challenges by 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
161
explaining â€œnot everything that is certified is by definition sustainable, but definitely not
everything that is sustainable is certified.â€ This provides considerable challenges for those
either wishing to produce or purchase environmentally sustainable seafood and to show that
they are doing so.
Defining environmentally sustainable practices and how best to assess them can vary
between and within stakeholder groups. For example, consumers in different countries â€œhave
different concepts of what sustainability means and different levels of urgency to address
those issuesâ€ (Transnational interviewee 19). At the site of salmon production in Tasmania
local actors defined environmental sustainability by its impact on the immediate environment
(e.g. benthic and water quality, fauna and flora and aesthetics). However, for the Chinese
consumer, any indication of environmental third-party certification is used as a proxy for
provenance. Provence indirectly implies food safety or freshness. Here, this is not a different
interpretation of sustainability but rather indicates that these customers value the supply
chain traceability associated with the certification label over sustainability. Furthermore,
ENGOs and those involved in certification had only just started to engage in matters of
environmental sustainability with the Chinese seafood supply chain (Transnational
interviewees 17 and 19). As China shifts to a net importer, rather than certifying Chinese
products, certification bodies and ENGO efforts were said to be focusing on raising awareness
of sustainable purchasing practices in China (Transnational interviewee 16). Additionally,
Chinese media and politics was said to be considerably complex to navigate (Asia-based
interviewee 29). For example, in order to gain access to moderated countries such as China,
the larger transnational ENGOs (e.g. WWF and Greenpeace) are said to act as more of a
consultant to government, rather than activist organisations (Asia-based interviewee 29). A 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region
162
speaker at the 2018 Asian Seafood Expo explained that the environmental sustainability of a
seafood product only becomes an area of concern or discourse theme in markets more
established than those in China (field notes, Asian Seafood Expo 2018).
6.6 Chapter summary
This chapter has explored the transnational flow of information, resources, perceptions and
governance of environmentally sustainable seafood. Tasmanian salmon aquaculture provided
a local context from which the research could expand. By traversing local and global scales,
this research contributed to understanding the mechanisms for which information regarding
the environmental risk of seafood production flows transnationally. In doing so it also
identified some of the risks of not addressing both local and global factors in communication
and governance strategies. It reveals how different actors determined whether the industry
was or was not meeting international environmental standards for farming salmon.
Contributing to the difficulty of communicating environmental sustainability is the apparent
lack of shared understanding concerning what constitutes environmentally sustainable
practices and how to govern this in an increasingly transnational operating environment.
Local and international perceptions and expectations regarding the sustainability
requirements of salmon companies did not align in the case of the Tasmanian salmon
industry. The interpretation and meaning of environmentally sustainable seafood production
shifts as it moves from the site of production through the supply chain to export markets.
These differences in the interpretations of environmental sustainability underpin stakeholder
conflicts at both local and international levels. The challenge for all actors is to ensure
communications and management practices and strategies address concerns at the local level
while operating within global governance, market and resource pressures. This will be 6 | Transnational discourses in the Australia-Asia region

discussed in depth in Chapter 8, which asks how the environmental risks of private use of
common pool natural resources are publicly negotiated across time and scale. It considers
how local and transnationally applied discourses of environmental sustainability and how
messages flow contributes to local and transnational public debate on environmental issues.7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway

7.1 Introduction
This final results chapter presents a comparative analysis of the mediatised environment
conflicts in Australia and Norway as two nations producing farmed Atlantic salmon. The
chapter explores how environmental risks of salmon aquaculture are presented and enacted
in media discourse, identify narratives that transcend political borders and physical
geography and those that differ between Atlantic salmon growing regions.
The two former results chapters (Chapters 5 and 6) traverse conceptual, spatial and temporal
aspects of environmental debates regarding Tasmanian salmon aquaculture which contribute
to important research gaps regarding news media of Tasmanian industry and local and
transnational discursive flows. This chapter serves to contextualise the learnings from the
Australian case study by testing it against environmental conflict in Norway. It compares
media representations of the Australian and Norwegian industries to tease out similarities
and differences at local and international scales and how media, risk and governance might
vary across cultures and geographies.
In this chapter, I explore how environmental risks of salmon aquaculture traverse different
scales of physical geography and public spheres by asking:
1) How are environmental risks of Tasmanian and Norwegian salmon aquaculture portrayed
in mediated environmental conflict?
2) By whom are these environmental risks negotiated in the mediated environmental
conflict? and
3) How do the two countries compare in their public negotiations of environmental risks?7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway

7.2 Themes in Australian and Norwegian news media
News media coverage of salmon aquaculture in Australia and Norway presented common
topics of: environmental risk, regulations and politics, economic prosperity and industry
expansion. Additionally, in Australian news media, common themes included: community
interests, environmental science, transparency, world class practices and third-party
certification, while in Norway industry innovation, new technology and feeding a global
population were prominent themes in the news discourse (Table 15).

Apart from financial information on the sector (i.e. salmon prices and financial reports),
environmental risk was the most common theme in news media of both Australia and
Norway. When discussing the topic of environment, both Norwegian and Australian news
media focused on environmental challenges and the management of these challenges (Olsen
and Osmundsen, 2017). While there were a range of environmental challenges associated
with salmon aquaculture in Norway, news media focused on issues associated with disease
and pathogen (lice) management of farmed fish, the risk of disease and pathogen transfer to
wild stocks along with the genetic harm to wild stocks due to escapes dominated the 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
167
environmental risk discourse. In Australia, concerns of environmental impact included
degradation of benthic habitat below the open net pens, depletion of dissolved oxygen,
health and mortality rates of farmed fish, impact on surrounding marine life (the endangered
Maugean skate, whales and seals) and impact on surrounding world heritage areas.

Environmental issues were linked broadly to the concept of sustainability in both countries (.
Table 16). Osmundsen and Olsen (2017) and Olsen and Osmundsen (2017) summarise the
narratives:
While the negative environmental impact was acknowledged by those that supported the
food production narrative, it was often portrayed in terms such as "sustainability" and "an
acceptable footprint" suggesting that this is both manageable and tolerable.â€ (Osmundsen
and Olsen, 2017: 139).
[T]he focus on sustainability was present, but both governmental representatives and
stakeholders (including newspaper journalists) mainly focused on the environmental
dimension of sustainability and as a result the economic and social dimensions were rarely 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
168
part of the debate about sustainable aquaculture production (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017:
23).
Misundâ€™s (2019) findings suggest that in Norway achieving sustainability relied on stricter
management as it had so far failed to solve problems of lice and escapees. Researchers, NGOs
and wild salmon organisations were said to speak to the insufficient regulatory mechanisms
available to manage the dispersion of lice. Governments acknowledged the requirement of
stronger sanctions and new measures, while Industry promoted the discourse that the
industry complied with regulatory requirements (Misund, 2019). Failure of environmental
regulations were also present in the Australian news media, but with a focus on the
assimilation of salmon waste in the surrounding environment. In both Australia and Norway
there is a lack of trust of regulatory mechanisms portrayed in media.
In Australia, achieving environmental sustainability was also linked to third-party certification
schemes which have been an emerging mechanism in news media. These schemes were
promoted by industry as a tool to achieve sustainability, while local opposition groups and
ENGOs discredit their legitimacy. Certification went from being positively framed in news
articles to being questioned by environmental campaigning groups following the airing of â€˜Big
Fishâ€™ which portrayed corporate relations between salmon companies and certification
organisations as corrupt. In contrast to the presence of third-party certification in Australian
mediated debates, Norwegian news articles were found to omit reference to the topic of
certification (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017). However, with the announcement of the â€˜greenâ€™
licences, Norway media had a solutions narrative regarding innovation and technologies to
solve their environmental challenges. While Australian companies were portrayed to
continue expanding without adequate precautions. 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
169
In response to the environmental risk discourse, government and industry in both Australian
and Norwegian news media applied a local and global benefits narrative. The narrative that
focused on local benefits was the same in the two countries promoting the economic
prosperity that the industry provides (Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017). However, the global
narrative was different in the two regions. Norwegian discourse represented an â€˜aquaculture
saves the global populationâ€™ narrative (Osmundsen and Olsen, 2017) while Australia had a
â€˜world-class practicesâ€™ narrative. The Australian narrative speaks to the benefits to the local
community compared with the Norwegian narrative which presents a global perspective on
food production and the sacrifices local community must make. While the narrative of â€˜world
class practicesâ€™ was employed by Australian government and industry, there appeared to be
less discussion over specific innovation compared to that of Norway.
The perceived government support for the exploitation of the environment to allow for
economic growth received criticism in both Norway (Tiller et al., 2012) and Australia. Both
Norway (KrÃ¸vel et al., 2019) and Australia share the same narrative of economic prosperity
versus environmental risk narrative. As (Osmundsen and Olsen, 2017: 136) summarised the
mediatised debate in Norway to be â€œâ€¦ between those in favour of a flourishing industry
producing food to a growing global population, and those who fear that such industrial
production may have irreversible consequences for marine ecosystems.â€ Osmundsen et al.
(2017) illuminates the fast pace at which technologies, environmental challenges and growth
of salmon aquaculture have evolved. The regulatory framework is required to adapt to this
constant evolution however science information struggle to keep up with developments in
the sector. This can create tension in the science-policy interface whereby science cannot
provide clear guidelines for, or likely consequences of, government decisions. This same 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
170
tension was experienced in Australia whereby uncertainty regarding the role of science in
government environmental regulation and planning processes was raised in news media. The
role of environmental science information in the management of salmon aquaculture was
prominent in Australian news discourse. Of particular focus was the transparency of this
information and how it informs decision-making processes that regulate the expansion of the
industry. Both the Australian and Norwegian news media highlighted the tension between
science and politics. A key difference between the two countries, however, was that scientists
in Norway appeared to be more willing to engage in debate regarding management compared
to those in Australia.
7.3 Stakeholder groups present in Australian and Norwegian news
media
Government regulators and politicians, salmon companies, NGOs, community members and
private individuals were present in both Norwegian and Australian news media that discussed
salmon aquaculture (Table 17). When looking at emerging stakeholder groups lawyers were
found to be an important contributor to the mediatised debate in Norway (Osmundsen and
Olsen, 2017) while in Australia it was community members and their interests. In comparison
to Norway media, scientists were relevantly absent from the Australian news articles, even
though science institutions were frequently referred to in the Australian news sample. The
reluctance of scientists in Australia to engage in politically charged highlights the tension
between science and politics. Comparatively, scientific experts contributed to 16.5% of the
opinion pieces in the Norwegian news media sample analysed by Osmundsen and Olsen
(2017), along with political parties (16.8%), private individuals (15%), NGOs (11.7%), industry
(8.8%), ministers (7.3%), public administration (5.10%), sports anglers (5.5%), and lawyers 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
171
(1.1%). Researchers were also said to be a key stakeholder contributing to discourse regarding
the management of lice in Norwegian news media (Misund, 2019).

There was one company in Norway (Mowi) and one in Australia (Huon Aquaculture) that left
industry peak bodies and separated themselves from other salmon aquaculture companies
based on their claim that regulations and current practices within the industry were not
meeting high enough environmental standards. The sector became divided in its
communications approach. This caused conflict and distrust (vicious cycles) rather that
promoting communication within the industry to present a unified voice.
7.4 Discursive themes identified in interviews
Interviewees across stakeholder groups and regions highlighted that publicised conflicts were
underpinned by discrepancies in what was considered acceptable levels of environmental
impact. To enter into negotiations of acceptability and environmental sustainability, the
credibility and legitimacy of stakeholders, information and communication mechanisms were
raised in interviews with key stakeholders in Australia and Norway (Table 18).7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway

Defining acceptable environmental impact and environmental
sustainability is ambiguous
Third-party certification was used by industry as a benchmark for
environmentally sustainable and acceptable practice
Environmental campaigns challenged the adequacy of Third-0party
certification standards
Industry stakeholders were reactive in their public communications
The primary mechanism for information provision by governments,
industry and Third-party certification was websites and reports
Mainstream media inhibits transparency
Transparency is important
Third-party certification was used by industry to mitigate the risk of
environmental campaigning
Industry and government communications were in the early stages of
growing and remained largely business to business
Scientists were cautious with their relationships with ENGOs to
maintain independence and credibility with industry stakeholders
Environmental campaigning organisations use environmental risks
experienced in other world regions to create risk discourses locally
Opposition groups in Australia identified the use of international sources to create local
environmental risk discourses:
The biggest fish farming industries in the world are in British Columbia, Scotland, and
Norway. The good thing we [opposition group] have found there is they are having huge
problems with their aquaculture industries with disease. So, information we can gather
from those countries that also are experiencing problems with their fish farming industries,
can be used as examples when we come out and quote that these are the sorts of issues
that we could have, or do already have. (Australia-based interviewee 4)7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
173
You have got these big huge companies in Norway, British Columbia, and Scotland getting
away from in-shore fish farms but here is our government still pushing ahead big time,
wanting to double the size of the industry by 2020, through having inshore coastal fish
farms all around Tasmania. So, itâ€™s really frustrating to see what is happening in other parts
of the world and we just blunder ahead the same old way we always have. (Australia-based
interviewee 3)
Industry stakeholders relied on third-party certification schemes to provide a level of certainty
that they were undertaking environmentally acceptable or sustainable practices. This was
particularly evident when claims were of a transnational nature (e.g. soy products used in fish
feed). However, environmental campaigning organisations in both Australia and Norway
claimed that certification standards were inadequate. Ambiguity within the definition of
sustainability and divergence in interpretations of sustainability between and among
stakeholder groups is reflected across interviewees that operated in Australia, Norway and
transnationally:
Most of the Norwegian soy is certified, we [ENGO] claim that the certification is not good
enough, but the feed producers say that it's certified so it's not a problem. So, we are
currently having a debate with them about if the certification is good enough or not, and
we say that there are limitations for that as well. (Norway-based interviewee 25)
Now theyâ€™re [ENGOs] trying to undermine the Aquaculture Stewardship Certification. So,
theyâ€™re actively saying, â€œItâ€™s not good enough.â€ And theyâ€™re developing their own charter,
so Environment Tasmania has come up with its own sustainable charter. If you compare
their points, seriously, itâ€™s eight points of criteria on their charter versus 150 for Aquaculture
Stewardship Certification. (Australia-based interviewee 8)7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
174
The public communications of industry and government regulators regarding the
management of environmental risk were said to be largely reactive rather than proactive.
Industry stakeholders identified a shift from business-to-business communications to
business-to-interested community. Response to this was seen by the growth in
communication departments and proactive communication strategies. Norwegian salmon
companies were said to be making efforts to mitigate mediated conflict by having annual
seminar-type discussions with ENGOs involved in the debate regarding environmental risks of
salmon aquaculture. It was stipulated that media were prohibited from being present to allow
for open discussion (Norway industry interviewee 23).
Government departments in both Norway and Australia indicated changes in their media
strategy to encompass social media. In Australia, salmon companies emphasised the shifting
focus from relying on internationally recognised standards and communications to portray
commitment to environmental sustainability and local community engagement. An
interviewee explained the new communication initiatives with local communities and the
importance for alignment between government and industry communication strategies:
Itâ€™s hard because itâ€™s a fine line between that [communicating complex environmental
information] and people think you are spinning stuff. I still think face to face is one of the
best ways. So, we [salmon aquaculture company] now have quarterly community meetings
and a community advisory in every region where we farm. Part of that is to support
Aquaculture Stewardship Certification (ASC) certification and part of it is a new modelâ€¦and
we are strong supporters of that despite everything you see swirling around [in the media],
we feel that has been a safe place in our opinion to go and talk about things. So, we have
enough people that phone calls can be returned and face to face meetings can happen. So
thatâ€™s an investment. We have developed our own social media page. We did market 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
175
research into it and Facebook was the best way to reach people in Tasmania. We developed
our own Facebook page and started disseminating information that way, kind of in response
to Marine Protections Facebook page. We have got five people and we're about to hire a
sixth person. We now have the routine engagement with the politicians which is more
pervasive in all of thisâ€¦There is a lot of stuff happening in that space that drives media and
drives outcomes. For instance, their [governments] announcement around the [new
farming region], we didn't want to go then. We didn't know they were going to go early, we
had two daysâ€™ notice. We had no say in how it went, and the community is going, "Well
nobody has talked to us". So, it wasn't ideal, and it really undermined everything we were
trying to do better this time, right? So that has a role. (Tasmania-based interviewee 7)
For the industry to have communication with publics that are transparent and proactive it
was suggested that the challenges of salmon farming should be acknowledged:
You have to be honest and accept the challenges and the problems and you need to do
something with that before you can say you are fully sustainable. (Norway-based
interviewee 24)
The media does give us [industry] a lot of the time when it comes to our challenges. When
it comes to sea lice when it comes to escapes and of course that is something that they
have to write about, they have to give it attention and I think one of the major problems
for the industry is that we in the industry we are not willing to talk with the media. We are
not willing to respond when the media are actually writing about us as an industry even
when it includes our problems like sea lice and escapes. (Norway-based interviewee 23)
However, ambiguity remains regarding the roles and responsibilities of publicly
communicating environmental risks of the salmon aquaculture sector and their management.
A Norwegian-based interviewee put the responsibility on industry:7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
176
We [government regulators] are not advocates for the industry. We are regulators. We are
trying to make sure that you have a developmental industry within sustainable framework.
But the industry has to be able to participate in public debates, and they donâ€™t. They seemed
very actively disengaged. (Norway-based interviewee 26)
When faced with potentially contentious topics, industry interviewees in both Australia and
Norway expressed their inclination to consult ENGOs that have scientists or experts within
their organisation. A Tasmanian-based ENGO that does not have a scientist on their team
suggested that they do not use science as an information source as much as they would like
to because: 1) they did not have access to a lot of the science (particularly that which is
industry funded) and 2) even if they did have access to science information they question the
independence and therefore credibility of such science. The interviewee explained that
because of the perceived institutionalised issue of transparency regarding science
information the ENGO had â€œno one to talk to other than overseas scientistsâ€ (Tasmania-based
interviewee 9):
Science could definitely be an information source, but until there is access to the science
the companies do and until there is some independent science that is not produced by the
companies, we are not going to be able to utilise that as an information sourceâ€¦There was
no independent science as far as I'm aware. If there was it was non-transparent because
we didn't know about it. So, the only thing that could verify [the companyâ€™s] claims that it
was mitigating impact was [the companyâ€™s] own report. The figures in the report don't even
add up because the feed input data hasn't been put in. (Tasmania-based interviewee 9)
At the time of writing there were 33 scientific studies of salmon aquaculture in Australia made
available on the website of the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies. While
environmental science might well be available, ENGOs and other concerned citizens may lack 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
177
the knowledge of where to find reports, or how to interpret them, as well as lack trust in
them.
Interviewees working in international science communication expressed that partnerships
with ENGOs, while important, could be perceived as damaging to their reputation as an
independent scientific organisation and subsequently their efforts to work collaboratively
with multi-national seafood companies:
yes, we [international science institution] do collaborate with other sort of non-academic
institutions even NGOs but we do have to be careful. We have to make sure that weâ€™re not
completely sort of used for their own agenda and we have to maintain our own merit and
very carefully maintain our scientific integrity in everything that we do. (Transnational
interviewee 20)
A transnational media interviewee identified that they engage with ENGOs that were seen to
actively participate in industry discourses:
Do you see them [ENGO workers] at industry events engaging with people? Do they have
some measure of scientific background in the topic? Are they kind of seen as fringe? Are
they the same people you have seen over and over just talking about it but not really
engaging? (Transnational Interviewee 21)
Similarly, Tasmanian interviewees indicated that government and corporate decision-makers
and journalists were quick to dismiss claims that they determined were not based on
â€œevidenceâ€ or lacked â€œmeritâ€. Determining the â€œmeritâ€ of an argument was highly subjective
and, as one interviewee explained, it depended on â€œyour level of understanding of the issueâ€
(Tasmania-based interviewee 14). 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway

7.5 Chapter summary
This chapter contributes to the knowledge of how environmental conflicts change depending
on the age of industry operations, different public spheres and levels of expansion. It makes
an argument about the trajectory of the Tasmanian industry as having emerged from the
Norwegian industry, flows of corporate practice, claims-making mechanisms, presence of
actors, risk, ideas and information. It does this by drawing on the media analysis presented in
Chapters 5 and 6 and a systematic review of scholarly accounts of Atlantic salmon aquaculture
discourses in Norwegian newspapers. To account for the limitations of comparing multiple
media analysis I drew on expert in-depth interviews with stakeholders that had expertise in
Tasmanian and Norwegian salmon aquaculture environmental governance and current
environmental conflicts. Direct observation of events that provided insight into the
Norwegian and Tasmanian Atlantic salmon aquaculture and seafood industries were
observed along with global seafood events to provide context to the findings.
The findings indicate that while broad themes of environmental challenge and risks
associated with the expansion and continued economic prosperity of the salmon aquaculture
sector are easily transferred globally, subthemes of risk are not as easily transferable between
growing regions. The scale of claims and subthemes differed between the two countries and
are not easily transferable. Tasmania was on the same trajectory as Norway regarding key
claims-making mechanisms. For example, the adequacy of decision-making mechanisms and
third-party certification standards were claims shared by environmental campaigns and
salmon aquaculture companies in both countries broke industry ranks because they
disagreed with management approaches. To counter local risk discourses, government and
industry stakeholders in both Australia and Norway were seen to promote global benefit 7 | International comparison: Australia and Norway
179
narratives. Norway promoted a narrative of local sacrifice in order to feed a global population,
while Australia focused on local benefit narratives of worldâ€™s best practice.
By asking questions of what messages are being carried, by whom and how, it was found that
legitimacy of stakeholders, information and risk definitions and interpretations were central
to negotiations in both countries. In both countries, environmental campaigning
organisations were less readily engaged by other stakeholders and the level of engagement
was determined by their scientific expertise, presence at industry events and capacity to
contribute to solving the environmental challenges the industry was facing.
Interviewees indicate that traditionally, industry communications have remained largely
business to business with a shift toward business to consumer. Communication departments
of industry and government regulators were growing in both Tasmania and Norway
acknowledging the substantial resources it takes to communicate complex issues as
transnational information technologies evolve.
This chapter has investigated change and evolution of the salmon aquaculture industry and
how environmental conflict is constructed in media. As each of the previous three results
chapters have exposed the flow of environmental risks locally and transnationally, how
different discourses work to create local and global communities of concern and how these
discursive scales interact, this leads to discussion regarding the implications for media and
communications processes of environmental risk. It finds that mediated visibility of
stakeholders and constructs of environmental risk signals the emergence for necessary
communicative practices within environmental governance.8 | Discussion

THESIS SYNTHESIS AND
DISCUSSION8 | Discussion
181
8.1 Introduction
This chapter synthesises the key findings from Chapters 5, 6 and 7 and deliberates on the
contributions these findings make to understanding how the environmental risks of private
use of common pool natural resources are publicly negotiated across time and scale. The
research aimed to explore the relationship between environmental campaigns, media and
communications and environmental governance to understand how this nexus contributes to
local and transnational public debate on environmental issues. This was done by exploring
locally contained media (Chapter 5), transnational flows of environmental risk information
and their cross-scale interactions (Chapters 6 and 7). Drawing on the depth of this case study
I highlight in this Chapter some of the implications this has on how environmental risks are
portrayed and potentially resolved in socio-ecological systems. Critical discourse analysis was
applied to extend the theory of mediatised environmental conflict (Hutchins and Lester, 2015)
to encompass the role of science in media representation of environmental governance
processes (see Chapter 4). The (in)visibility of scientists and science information was first
uncovered in Chapter 5 and tested further in Chapter 7. Below, I will continue to draw upon
the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture case, and seafood more broadly, with examples where
useful, giving consideration to local and global context and transnational realities.
The research started by examining how environmental risks are constructed publicly at the
local level. I found that news media discourse regarding the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry was predominantly framed by environmental risk, economic prosperity, expansion
of the industry and government regulation. Within these themes, environmental science and
community interests became conflated. The themes were characterised by a perceived lack
of transparency regarding environmental science information and lack of trust in the 8 | Discussion
182
regulation of industry expansion. Once I understood how the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry was being framed in news media, I could then ask by whom these themes were being
carried. The most mentioned stakeholder groups in news media were government, salmon
companies and science institutions respectively, suggesting the leverage they hold to
facilitate virtuous cycles in conflict over the use of common pool natural resources.
At the time of this study, public conflict persisted about the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry, exposing entrenched vicious cycles that have prevailed since the work of Leith and
colleagues in 2014. By a) identifying and analysing dominant themes and stakeholders within
news media coverage, particularly where disputed and ambiguous social and scientific
information appears; and b) considering how associated media practices and logics might
influence outcomes of complex common pool natural resource-use conflicts, reflection on
this earlier work by Leith et al. (2014b) can be undertaken and examine how this contention
is presented in media and scholarship. It offers the opportunity to assess how the prevalent
risk themes following national media scrutiny of the industry might have contributed to
vicious cycles in the public sphere. This can also contribute to understanding how vicious and
virtuous cycles were performed by various participants in the mediatised debate. This can
help inform pathways for virtuous cycles by better understanding how science, societal values
and decision-making (Leith et al., 2014b) are negotiated in news media.
Chapter 5 uncovered how different forms of inquiry into environmental risk is responded to.
News coverage following the Four Corners episode was framed by a conflict discourse
compared to that of the Senate Inquiry, which industry had embraced as an opportunity to
be transparent. The impact this had on how different information was perceived, for example
science, is highlighted in this thesis. While scientists themselves remained largely invisible in 8 | Discussion
183
media coverage of the conflicts, science information and community interests (the two
becoming increasingly conflated) became visible following Four Corners. In response to
increased conflict, industry and government actors responded with claims of â€œworld classâ€
environmental practices and standards. However, these stakeholder groups were portrayed
to be outwardly opaque in their communications of, and lacking engagement in, decision
making processes, creating uncertainty and lack of trust in these processes.
Chapter 6 highlighted that claims of worldâ€™s best practice and global governance mechanisms
regarding environmental sustainability applied at the local level were not as easily accepted
where transnational flows of information regarding environmental practices and concerns
were sought out and carried by social actors in the context of transnational environmental
campaigning. Third-party certification was used and promoted by industry as a benchmark for
environmentally sustainable practices and as a means of managing the risk of environmental
campaigning. However, discrepancies in what was considered acceptable environmental
impact between local ENGOs and certification schemes was observed in the research and was
said to create confusion regarding acceptable environmental impact. Additionally, third-party
certification in the context of export markets, in this case the Chinese consumer and the
Australian brand, indicated that the food is safe, rather than environmentally sustainable. This
indicates a gap between local debates at the site of production in Tasmania and the values of
the industries international markets. Not only was there a disconnect between international
standards and how they were expected to be applied locally, but also how different markets
interpret environmental sustainability and what that might mean for local operations.
To test the trajectory of the Tasmanian industry, Chapter 7 introduced knowledge gathered
of the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry into the thesis. This Chapter found that while 8 | Discussion
184
broad themes of environmental risk were shared between both Tasmania and Norway, subtle
differences in the mediatised discourses shed light on opportunities and challenges present
in governance mechanisms. Tasmania was on a similar trajectory regarding industry relations
and broad themes in the mediatised conflicts. However, the two growing regions experienced
different environmental risks and governance structures. This can be seen in how the local
and global discourse were framed in media. This also showed that while broad themes are
easily transferable, subthemes were dependent on local conditions.
The next sections in this chapter will elaborate on the implications and opportunities of these
findings. It begins with discussion on transnational flows and how the local and global interact
before focusing on the research questions regarding what and who is being mediatised and
social acceptance of communicative environmental governance mechanisms. I finish this
chapter with a discussion of mediaâ€™s role in transparency and accountability of salmon
aquaculture governance.
8.2 Summary of findings
8.2.1 RQ1) What are the dominant claims and counter-claims being
mediated in relation to environmental risk?
As seen in Chapters 5 and 7, news media coverage of salmon aquaculture has increased over
time in both Australia and Norway. Tiller et al. (2012) suggested that Norwegian media
coverage of salmon aquaculture followed either environmental impact events (i.e. lice
problems and impacts on wild salmon stocks) or changes in planning, such as expansion. This
was also reflected in Australian media coverage of salmon aquaculture which followed
environmental impact and expansion proposals. 8 | Discussion
185
The dominant environmental framing of the media debate presented in Chapter 5 appeared
to be triggered by the expansion of industry practices in existing and new locations.
Subsequently, the adequacy of government regulation and private governance structures to
manage these environmental risks was debated. Concerns of environmental impact, the
adequacy of government regulation and lack of transparency that were evident in Leith et alâ€™s
2014 work were still prevalent in the Tasmanian debates at the time of this study. Experiences
of environmental impact of industry expansion in Macquarie Harbour provided grounding for
continued public concerns regarding expansion proposals, primarily those from Tassal. The
perceived lack of engagement by government and industry decision-makers and transparency
of decision-making processes had reinforced the distrust in the environmental management
of the industries expansion. This included the science knowledge production institutions and
processes that informed this decision-making.
At the centre of this heightened conflict was the struggle between the economic prosperity
and environmental preservation agendas. The environmental protection narrative prompted
the counter claim of economic prosperity. The struggle between these two discourse frames
was systemic in public debates of industry expansion. These competing discourses were
placed within a broader discourse of sustainability which remained ambiguous with little
clarity regarding what aspects of sustainability were being referred to. Aquaculture practices
that are financially sustainable may not fit within environmentally sustainable boundaries.
While environmental sustainability was often implied and seen as essential for achieving
growth, there was little information communicated through media provided for how this was
defined and being achieved. This was embodied by what appeared to be a space for 8 | Discussion
186
negotiation at the interface between environmental science, government and salmon
aquaculture companies and a lack of transparency regarding this process.
Within these themes of environmental risk, sustainability and regulation, environmental
science and community interests became conflated. The conflation of community interests
and science information is an important finding in terms of deliberative democracy and public
interest. Community concerns regarding environmental science were primarily characterised
by a perceived lack of transparency regarding environmental science information and lack of
trust in how it was used in the decisions regarding industry expansion. The combination of
the environmental risk discourse with that of poor management was further fuelled by Huon
Aquacultureâ€™s legal actions against the government claiming inadequate environmental
regulation. Irrespective of whether or not the government decision-making processes were
adequately managing the environment with the information they had or considering a range
of information (such as environmental impact data, interests of other users of the waters and
economic benefits to regional communities), the government was portrayed to be outwardly
opaque in their communications of these processes.
In the case of Tasmanian salmon, scientific information was used as a political tool by actors
within media coverage of the environmental conflict. Following the Senate Inquiry, while
some debate concerning the validity of the science-based information was present, this was
not one of the more prominent features in the news articles. Comparatively, articles where
the validity of the scientific information was debated, and information was selectively wielded
to support agendas, actions or statements were more frequent following Four Corners. As a
result, uncertainty was created concerning the independence, relevance, and role of science 8 | Discussion
187
in informing opposition campaigns, corporate decisions, and Government regulations
regarding the environmental impact of the industry.
8.2.2 RQ2) How and by whom are environmental risks being
negotiated publicly?
As shown in Chapter 5, government, salmon aquaculture companies and science institutions
were the most mentioned stakeholder groups respectively in the news media regarding
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture. This suggested that these stakeholders could hold the most
leverage to influence the public discourse and therefore facilitate virtuous cycles. The idea
that industry and government stakeholders hold the most potential to influence media
coverage and therefore play â€œimportant roles in strengthening communications and
improving the transparency of information especially surrounding public issues of concernâ€ is
evident in similar work by Weitzman and Bailey (2019: 180). However, these stakeholder
groups were portrayed to be outwardly ambiguous in their communications of decision
making processes or their involvement in these processes.
Environmental opposition groups had a relatively low â€œmediated visibilityâ€ (Thompson, 2005).
The results presented in Chapter 5 indicate that critical moments in the discourse were not
solely a result of environmental campaigns, which have historically played a significant role in
environmental discourse in Tasmania (see Cullen-Knox et al., 2017b, Murphy-Gregory, 2017,
Lester, 2016b). Rather, concerns of inadequate regulation raised by Huon Aquaculture (also
seen in Norway, see Chapter 7) was the catalyst for much of the public discourse regarding
the environmental risk and impact of the industry. In the case of Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture, Environment Tasmania was shown to leverage these critical moments for its
own strategic purposes. This is not to say that these campaigning organisations did not 8 | Discussion
188
provide a solid grounding for corporate players to use the environmental discourse as a
legitimate source of concern. However, it exemplified a shift in the traditional role of ENGOs
in holding industries and Governments to account, to an industry player taking this role.
In the case of Tasmanian salmon, scientific information was used as a political tool by actors
within the conflict (see Chapter 5). Yet notably absent from the media discourse was scientists
themselves, particularly given the frequent reference made to scientific information and
findings and the scientific institutions in media. Given the dominance of the environmental
risk discourse and the acknowledgement and use of scientific information in claims and
counter-claims by non-experts, the lack of participation by scientists themselves in media
discourse was a discernible gap. In comparison, as shown in Chapter 7, scientists and
researchers had a notable presence in the opinion pieces of selected Norwegian newspapers
(Osmundsen and Olsen, 2017).
8.2.3 RQ3) How do local mediatised environmental conflicts and
transnational discourses of environmental sustainability
interact?
Broadly, this research found that the practice of farming salmon was placed within the
overarching theme of sustainability across local and global discourses (Chapters 5 and 6).
Disagreement concerning the environmental risks of salmon aquaculture and the
management of these is evident in both Norwegian and Australian news media (Chapter 7).
This confirmed that the saliency of these issues in the public discourse was not only present
in both countries but also at a global level. The sustainability of salmon aquaculture and its
management is a complex problem (Sandersen and Kvalvik, 2015, Osmundsen et al., 2017)
that had been simplified in news media in both countries into a binary tension between
environmental impact and economic prosperity. When discussing sustainability, it was often 8 | Discussion
189
the environmental sustainability that was implied but often not made explicit. While
environmental risk was a key theme in both Australian and Norwegian media the foci of these
risks varied between countries. In Norway, pathogens (i.e. lice) were the primary limiting
environmental risk. While in Australia it was the assimilation of salmon waste into the
surrounding environment. In both countries, the perceptions regarding the adequacy of the
management of these environmental risks was prevalent within the environmental risk
discourse.
Campaigns of both ENGOs and salmon companies targeted alternative third-party decision
making mechanisms and standards because they disagreed with public agency management
standards and frameworks. This discourse also provided an opportunity for Huon Aquaculture
to pursue competitive advantage. Chapters 6 and 7 highlighted that the transnational flow of
environmental risks contributed to the complexity of interpretations and measurements of
acceptable environmental impact at the local level. Australian opposition groups saw the
environmental risks experienced in other world regions as an opportunity to create risk
discourses locally and create â€˜awarenessâ€™ of potential environmental risks. However, many of
the environmental impacts of farmed salmon faced by the aquaculture sector in Europe were
not applicable to Australia (Haward, 2016). This transnational flow of, at the time inapplicable,
environmental risk discourses could potentially detract from the risk experienced in a given
area. This risk framing could either highlight potential risks that could benefit from proactive
management or inhibit the likelihood that resources were most usefully applied to mitigate
experienced environmental impact.
To counter local risk discourses, government and industry stakeholders in both Australia and
Norway were seen to promote global benefit narratives. Norway promoted a narrative of 8 | Discussion
190
local sacrifice in order to feed a global population. While Australia focused on local benefit
narratives by promoting the industry implementing worldâ€™s best practice to ensure local
environmental risks were minimised. Community members and emergent local community
opposition groups were key emergent stakeholder groups in the Australian news media.
Similarly, Tasmanian based interviewees often focused on local benefits, risks and local
community engagement strategies. Whereas Norway claims-makers and decision-makers
applied national and global lenses to their narratives. In Norway, Salmon farms are governed
by the local municipalities, for which they pay rent fees too. This means that the local
community directly experiences the benefits of having salmon aquaculture in their local area
(Berge, 2018). This could be why the issue of local community benefits was not as evident in
Norwayâ€™s news media. The local focus in Australia could be due to the Australian salmon
aquaculture industry operating in a small island state compared to the Norwegian industry
which spans vast coastlines across the country. Many of the stakeholders in Norway also
operated on a transnational scale with multinational salmon aquaculture companies, global
media outlets and, ENGOs addressing impacts of aquaculture experienced in other countries.
Additionally, the opposition (presented in Chapter 5) against Tassal highlighted that it was
not sufficient enough to rely on third-party certification alone to demonstrate commitment
to environmental sustainability. While Tassal focused on achieving international standards in
environmental sustainability and reporting (Aquaculture Stewardship Council certification),
the company was said to have lacked local stakeholder engagement at the site of production.
Local opposition groups voiced concerns regarding the perceived lack of transparency of the
Tasmanian salmon industry, particularly Tassal. Meanwhile, Chapter 6 showed that the
company received international praise for transparency regarding its sustainability reporting. 8 | Discussion
191
Interviewees reported that the company was potentially too complacent in its expectation
that their commitment to achieving international environmental and reporting standards
would filter through to, and be accepted by, local communities. This was perceived to have
contributed to the opposition from a portion of concerned communities in Tasmania and a
disconnect between these groups and international standard-setting stakeholders and actors.
8.2.4 RQ4) What are the roles of media and what are the processes of
mediatisation in communicative governance in cases of
environmental risk?
The Four Corners episode â€˜Big Fishâ€™ created considerable conflict and complexity in the
interactions between and among stakeholder groups within Tasmania. The television
program instigated conflict language that reinforced extremist positions and hostility among
and between stakeholder groups. This was a one-way information flow lacking transparency
regarding information gathering and processing practices. It was evident in this case that
media events such as Four Corners can instigate greater news media attention, involvement
and diversity of actors, emphasis on alliances and conflicts, debate over governance along
with the raising of concerns regarding the legitimacy of knowledge and information. While
the â€˜Big Fishâ€™ episode may not have been the sole cause for the conflict present in news media
discourse, it did appear to be the platform for which opposition groups, political parties,
salmon companies, community members and journalists built and shaped their case. Thus,
public perception was inevitably shaped by processes of mediatisation.
The Senate Inquiry and Four Corners were instigated by conflict internal to industry rather
than environmental campaigning. It was following â€˜Big Fishâ€™ that industry cohesion visibly
deteriorated and was highly visible in news media coverage. Discourse shifted away from
addressing the industry as a whole and claims-against companies themselves became 8 | Discussion
192
prevalent in the news discourse. Comparatively, the government-led Senate Inquiry provided
a transparent and inclusive platform for collection of information (submissions) and
deliberative dialogue (hearings) and a presentation of findings. This subsequently resulted in
comparably less complexity and conflict in the news media. It could be construed that Huon
Aquacultureâ€™s breaking of industry ranks, first present in the Senate Inquiry and publicised in
Four Corners, acted as the prompt for the shift in public discourse.
It was portrayed in news media that without media scrutiny of environmental science and
management, the environmental impact experienced in Macquarie Harbour would continue.
This was represented by Huon Aquaculture, political opposition parties, journalists and
community members. The narrative of uncertainty and distrust was heightened when Huon
Aquaculture contested environmental regulations by taking legal action against the
government and condemning the environmental impact of the industry within media. This
publicly highlighted the variation in definitions of appropriate level of environmental risk
among and between industry, government regulations and third-party certification providers
along with a lack of healthy discussion processes within industry to agree on these.
By revisiting the research questions, the analysis presented in Chapter 5 has established that
the Four Corners program and Senate Inquiry were able to promote different framing and
engagement with the perceived issues of the Tasmanian salmon industry. The Senate Inquiry
process provided a platform for dialogue regarding the claims being made concerning the
regulation of the industryâ€™s expansion. Comparatively, Four Corners was a one-way
information stream outward which contained the controlled and subjective information it
chose to source and include. Public debate, as conveyed in news media, was more contained
in the Senate Inquiry compared with Four Corners. It could be that this was because of the 8 | Discussion
193
formality of the Senate Inquiry compared to the controversy presented by the Four Corners
program, activating a discourse of conflict between and among key stakeholder groups.
It has been acknowledged that popular â€˜soft journalismâ€™ programs, such as Four Corners, have
the capacity to create frames that are then difficult to dislodge in subsequent public debate
(Lester and Hutchins, 2012). The impact this has on how different information is perceived,
for example science, has been highlighted in this study. While Leith et al. (2014b)
acknowledge the usefulness of deliberative processes to link science, societal values and
decision-making, this thesis provides greater detail of this process in the context of conflict
that plays out within media. It has raised important questions regarding the role media play
(both claimed and actual) as a catalyst for change for how environmental risks are negotiated.
In this space, media have a delicate role to play in democracy â€“ is it their job to be a conduit
or contributor? Do media act to hold decision-makers and claims-makers to account or are
they a business with their own agenda to prosecute? Mediaâ€™s role in transparency and
accountability of natural resource governance processes is discussed in more detail in the
following section.
8.3 Insights and implications for mediatised environmental conflict
and environmental governance
8.3.1 Information flows closing and widening the gap between local
and global perceptions of environmental best practice
The transnational flow of environmental risks complicates interpretations and measurements
of social acceptability of such natural resource-based industrial activity. The thesis supports
existing theory that information about the environmental risks of salmon aquaculture do not
simply â€œflow freely and unmediated across oceans and continentsâ€ (Bocking, 2012: 720).
Contrary to popular belief â€œthe role of the internet in determining what information should 8 | Discussion
194
be communicated, and how, has been secondary to that played by social mechanisms of
information movementâ€ (Bocking, 2012:720). This contradicts a free-flowing form of
transnationalism. It says that information flows are controlled by transnational actors, rather
than flowing freely in a transnational context.
This thesis has shown that variation in environmental best practice and sustainability
perceptions create stakeholder conflicts at both local and international levels. The disconnect
between local and global definitions of environmental sustainability and the conflicts and
confusion this can create between claims-makers and decisions-makers has been highlighted.
Also emphasised is the influence media and ENGOs can have on how decisions regarding
natural resource management are communicated (e.g. pressures for local management
reform can come from the international community influencing local grass-roots
organisations), and how media coverage in foreign countries can affect buyers' choices in a
key export market such as China.
Global narratives are employed by stakeholders to give local claims validity. Actors in this
study used references to global standards to either endorse or discredit local actions. This
strategy either closed the gap between the local and global or distanced the two. Both
strategies were employed to serve the same purpose of measuring local environmental risk
of salmon aquaculture. For example, in attempting to close the gap, the Tasmanian
government and industry actors initiated claims of worldâ€™s best practice, world class
production methods and promoted third-party certification as assurances that local-level
environmental risks were sustainably managed. In Norway, the government was seen to close
the gap between local and global by endorsing the sectorâ€™s role in producing a healthy source
of protein for a growing global population. Concurrently, opposition groups in Tasmania 8 | Discussion
195
promoted scientific and news material from other countries that farm salmon to support
assertions of environmental risk in Tasmania. Here ENGOs are leveraging the notion of a
â€œtransnational community of concernâ€ (Lester, 2014) to legitimise their claims. This strategy
aligns with Olsen and Osmundsenâ€™s (2017) media analysis of salmon aquaculture in Norway,
which finds that connection made with global discourse can have a greater influence on the
perceptions of the environmental risks of aquaculture compared to local experiences.
Alternatively, ENGOs in Tasmania also created a gap between local and global standards to
portray a perceived mismanagement at the local level and attacked the Aquaculture
Stewardship Council (ASC) for being corrupt. Here the ASC standard might well be considered
adequate as a form of third-party certification but inadequate in its application. What is also
not considered in this use of international references in the Tasmanian case is that different
growing regions experience different social and environmental challenges (Vince and Haward,
2017).
This study has shown that environmental campaigns at the global scale, historically
uncontested, are now being challenged at the same scale and same efficacy by industry
organisations. It is evident that companies are considering how they engage with publics at
the range of scales across which they operate. While industry recognition and adoption of
two-way engagement with local publics was prominent during interviews, so too was
acknowledgement of the global response to environmental campaigning, representing
industry interests at the global scale. Actors operating at the transnational level identified the
historic absence of an entity representing industry to respond to environmental claims at this
scale. However, this is changing, evidenced by the rise of: global third-party certification
schemes, global sustainability initiatives (both initiated â€“ GSI â€“ or joined by â€“ seaBOS â€“8 | Discussion
196
seafood companies) and global sustainability and communication departments within
companies. This shift in players in global environmental risk discourses has been said to
improve the accuracy of claims being made at this scale as they are now being contested.
However, it is clear in this research that companies are leveraging the environmental
discourse but driven by corporate interests.
8.3.2 Challenges of third-party certification as a tool to communicate
best practice across scale
Third-party certification has been a key mechanism for companies to portray commitment to
environmental sustainability and mitigate risks of environmental campaigning by going
beyond regulatory requirements. Norwegian industry interviewees referred to certification
schemes as mechanisms for managing environmental concerns raised in environmental
campaigns, particularly transnational issues such as the ingredients sourced for fish food.
While certification provides a mechanism for which companies can go beyond regulatory
requirements to obtain or maintain a social license to operate, this thesis reinforces that this
is not sufficient alone (see also Vince and Haward, 2019). Third-party certification of a product
does not guarantee local acceptance of a practice, nor should it form the only mechanism by
which a company demonstrates or defines best practice. This is because certification lacks
contextual features of sustainability. Hence, in instances where the certification standards
would be considered sufficient, it may not be locally trusted or applied. Local and
transnational environmental campaigns in Australia, Norway and China criticised global
certification programs and certified products, resulting in a widening of the gap between local
impacts and international standards. In response, companies are having to adapt to local and
global demands by going beyond what is stipulated in standards (voluntary or regulated) in 8 | Discussion
197
order to adapt to shifting conditions of the SLO. For example, in Tasmania salmon companies
had focused on building trust in impacted communities by undertaking meetings with local
communities before expanding into new areas.
The disconnect between local and international interpretations of best practice was initially
only evident through piecing together discourse in news media. However, the gap between
local and international interpretations and applications of environmental best practice was
later made obvious when local ENGO Environment Tasmania campaigned against the
transnational ENGO World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the ASC and their partnership
and certification of Tassal (Environment Tasmania, 2017). Given the national and
international credibility the WWF and ASC symbol holds and the market capacity this has to
promote the idea of sustainability and associated practices, it becomes a question of what is
considered legitimate application of environmentally sustainable standards to different
actors in different world regions. Environment Tasmania also collaborated with the
transnational ENGO, Marine Stewardship Council, to develop a sustainable salmon consumer
guide. Seafood guides have been a long-standing tool used by ENGOs to promote their
perceptions of environmentally sustainable practices to consumers. However, these have also
highlighted the lack of consensus among ENGOs and between ENGOs and industry when
defining sustainable seafood (Roheim, 2009). This inconsistency is also evidenced by the
various sustainability criteria and indicators used in the multitude of third-party certification
schemes creating confusion with regards to sustainability objectives and targets (Osmundsen
et al., 2020). This again demonstrates and reinforces the ambiguity of the term sustainability
and the various ways in which it can be defined and used, a reoccurring finding in this
research. Additionally, certification schemes have been criticised for favouring large-scale 8 | Discussion
198
fisheries in the developed world. This highlights that while balancing local and global
communications is challenging, it is important to ensure one is not considered without the
other, especially when supply chains of both product and information have local and global
dimensions (Olson et al., 2014). This aligns with ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdaÌ€â€™s argument that local
interests and concerns should never be discounted in global communications and governance
(2015).
This thesis affirms that it cannot be assumed that global scale environmental risk discourse
will automatically transfer to local contexts. It indicates the high level of adaptability and
reflexivity required to engage and operate in complex and dynamic issues of sustainability
across scales. Brought to the forefront in Chapter 6 is the importance, and at times difficulty,
of acknowledging and attempting to reconcile between local and international standards
regarding acceptable environmental risk. Aligning local expectations and interpretations of
environmental impact (identified by environmental campaigning) and global standards (e.g.
ASC certification) is complex and the processes poorly communicated. Local ENGOs claim that
global standards do not fit the local reality. If, as stated earlier, transnational flows of
information make it easy for claims of worldâ€™s best practice to be challenged, this highlights
the role of ENGOs and media in the selection and distribution of that information, given their
transnational networks. Equally, the thesis highlights the capacity for these transnational
flows to transfer information to sites of local production and influence environmental risk
discourse on the basis of transnational claims that do not reflect, or are irrelevant to, the risk
issues at hand.
Local environmental campaigning and global market mechanisms can be demanding different
standards and improvements in environmentally sustainable practices. This presents 8 | Discussion
199
challenges for the producer, seller and buyer to determine the trade-offs when these
positions or interests are countervailing. The thesis contributes to the gap in the literature
regarding how these global dimensions affect local discourses and governance and how these
changes in local discourse and governance in turn affect global discourse and governance.
Such a research agenda becomes increasingly important as the transnational dimensions of
seafood grows, with progression in, for example, global third-party certification, international
markets and global opposition groups.
8.3.3 The transnational role of environmental campaigning and media
in defining acceptable practices in the Australia-Asia region
The degree of contestation over the environmental sustainability status and credentials of
seafood, and international variations of what is considered acceptable environmental impact,
may explain why the strategies of ENGOs operating in the transnational space were said in
interviews to be shifting. Rather than ENGOs solely being organisations for protest and
campaigning, actors throughout the supply chain (in both Asia and Norway) perceived some
ENGOs as sources of expertise and insight into environmental issues and transnational social
networks. Often carried through media, they provided early warning mechanisms for
potential public reputations issues and interpreters of publicly acceptable levels of risk. They
also offered expertise in not only how to produce and purchase environmentally sustainable
products but also in how to influence the international social networks involved in
environmental sustainability. ENGOs were seen to be utilising processes whereby they create
environmental discourse through the supply chains by using the resources of large retail
companies to send messages transnationally, easily targeting key decision-makers within the
supply chain. Nonetheless, in a key export market for Australian seafood such as China, media 8 | Discussion
200
coverage can be a powerful driver when it affects buyers' choices. This suggests that rather
than local conflicts from the site of production transferring to international markets, it is more
likely that Chinese media and ENGOs could have persuasive power over the standards on
imported product. While some ENGOs and journalists in China have been successful in raising
awareness and in some cases stopping the import of what they consider environmentally
unsustainable seafood product, these actors express the difficulty of operating in China. The
interviews identified the apparent lack of ENGO presence in Asian countries compared to
most western countries due to greater governmental control over media and public
comment.
While China is the major export market for Australian farmed salmon it is also a country that
many of the interviewees who work transnationally knew little about. Only in recent years
have these actors begun to engage in issues of environmental sustainability within China. This
lack of engagement could explain why Asian consumers have less exposure and/or desire to
address environmental concerns in their purchasing practices (Fabinyi, 2016). Therefore, if
exports to Asian markets continue to grow as predicted (Inehan, 2013) yet Asian consumer
preferences do not send signals through markets for environmentally sustainable product and
environmental harm is determined to be occurring at the site of production, then non-market
mechanisms such as protest campaigns and public agency regulation could have a greater
role to play to ensure environmental sustainable standards are met. The interviewees also
discussed the implications for global net environmental impact of seafood production,
because of the ease of product substitution. This highlights the responsibility of ENGOs
running environmental campaigns based on perceived environmental risk to consider
possible unintended consequences â€“ for example, increased exploitation of less managed 8 | Discussion
201
fisheries close to markets to meet food security needs if imported product is halted due to
successful market campaigns.
8.3.4 Public legitimacy of ENGOs and environmental campaigning in
environmental conflict discourses
The traditional role of ENGOs in holding industries and governmentsto account is now shared
with industry players. While industry organisations and companies have become prominent
in promoting environmental sustainability objectives, the interests and values that drive these
objectives is different to that of ENGOs. These guiding priorities are identified by Vormedal
(2017: 55) in her analysis of the drivers of Mowiâ€™s proactive sustainability strategy stating
â€œthat company-specific motives have been central. While contextual factors, such as NGO
pressure, globalization and consumer-market trends, have influenced strategic options and
choices, they seem to have been filtered through a company specific lensâ€. Vormedal
identifies the key motives of such a proactive strategy include:
(i) to prevent environmental problems from escalating into a costly crisis â€“ a major lesson
from the Chile experience; (ii) to maintain high salmon prices; (iii) to sell salmon to buyers
who impose environmental standards; (iv) to protect and strengthen the companyâ€™s
competitive positioning; (v) to maintain a good reputation and avoid negative publicity; (vi)
to safeguard the social license to operate by making sustainable development central to
the companyâ€™s business model. Further, the analysis has shown how MHâ€™s proactive
strategy is driven by globalization, and made possible by the companyâ€™s large size and vast
resources. (Vormedal, 2017: 55).
Here, the intrinsic value of the environment is lost and replaced with corporate-centric values. 8 | Discussion
202
The findings of the thesis raise the question of what is considered a legitimate relationship
between ENGOs and industry actors. Attention to these relationshipsin the case of Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture was heightened following the Four Corners program with the
introduction of a contentious relationship occurring between local ENGO, Environmental
Tasmania, and salmon company Huon Aquaculture, and between transnational ENGO, WWF,
and salmon company Tassal. If Environment Tasmaniaâ€™s support for Huon Aquaculture was
broadly portrayed as legitimate while WWFâ€™s partnership with Tassal was framed as corrupt,
this adds considerable complexity regarding what constitutes a legitimate partnership
between an ENGO and corporate entity. The impact that the increased complexity of these
relationships and greater number of actors has on the governance of the salmon aquaculture
industry in Tasmania is an important area for further research and more broadly in other
sectors and locations. Literature on European fisheries governance notes the rapid shift
(compared to other areas of environmental governance) in the role of ENGOs from identifying
problems and advocacy campaigning to partaking in collaborations for their solutions and
management (Dunn, 2005, Espinosa-Romero et al., 2014). This is not to say that problem
identification and campaigning has become obsolete but that there has been considerable
recognition in the importance for progressing potential solutions for what is being
campaigned for. Here, ENGOs are not confined to either role but rather their role broadens
to encompass both identifying problems and their solutions.
The degree to which industry, government and industry focused journalists that participated
in this study were willing to engage with opposition groups was, at times, determined by how
much their claims appeared to reflect an understanding of scientific information and the
general operating environment of government and industry. For example, the dismissal of 8 | Discussion
203
comments referring to anything other than what they consider â€˜factâ€™ or those that have
â€˜meritâ€™ highlighted the imbalance of power in environmental conflicts. An ENGOâ€™s level of
scientific understanding of environmental issues was said to determine how legitimate they
were perceived to be. This was linked with frustration regarding misinformed claims-making,
again highlighting the gap between claims-makers and decision-makers. This contributes to a
vicious cycle of conflict by promoting the view that values (such as aesthetics and human
wellbeing) outside of environmental damage are considered illegitimate risk framing
(Cordner, 2015). This could result in a situation where concerned citizens or other
stakeholders employ a risk frame (or misinformation) characterised by environmental impact
in order to legitimately be involved in debate regarding the suitability of a site for marine
farming. The presence of misinformation in public debates could be an indicator of power
struggles and lack of reflexivity and adaptability of governance structures and campaigning
groups. This vicious cycle encourages the politicisation of science and its placement in socio
political issues, potentially damaging both valid scientific and values-based information and
claims. In Maeseeleâ€™s (2009: 69) research â€œlocal NGOs are found to perform a role as
alternative science communicators who wish (1) to instigate an epistemic shift to an
uncertainty-oriented approach in risk assessment, and (2) reframe the (values at stake in the)
debateâ€ â€¦ Maeseele (2009: 70) concludes by making the argument that:
â€œit is only by framing scientific and technological developments as social issues, in which
conflicting epistemological, normative and axiological views are exposed, that news media
live up to their role as facilitators of public discussion and (science) democratisation. Here
the role of NGOs as alternative science communicators could prove particularly valuableâ€.
(Maeseele (2009: 70)8 | Discussion
204
This is one perspective as to the role of media and the shifting media landscape. Further
research into not only the relationships between claims-makers and decision-makers but the
apparent blurring of what constitutes and defines these roles could allow for insights into the
processes of influence and framing in the governance of not only salmon aquaculture but
other sectors.
8.3.5 The (in)visibility of scientists in media discourses
The critical role of independent and appropriate science in Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
governance was undisputed in news media discourse. However, claims and counter-claims
regarding the level of independence and transparency of science information were prevalent.
In interview, scientists expressed their reluctance to contribute to the deliberations over risk
definitions in media. Research by Osmundsen et al. (2017) identified that mainstream media
play a key role in exacerbating the gap between expert and lay knowledge. The media
discourse following the Four Corners episode would support this. Environmental science was
used in media discourse to support stakeholdersâ€™ framing of acceptable environmental risk.
While there is frequent reference to science information and science institutions, the use of
science to support competing claims and agendas could explain why scientists themselves
were notably absent from the Tasmanian news media. The presence of scientists in Norway
opinion pieces and the absence of scientists in Tasmanian news media indicates that it would
be useful to investigate the institutional structures that might explain the visibility of scientists
in the mediated environmental debate. This could reveal communications opportunities and
barriers in evidence-based decision-making where public debate is heightened (e.g. Kuehne
et al., 2014, Brossard, 2013, Roll-Hansen, 1994). 8 | Discussion
205
How scientists and science information (and its role in informing the management of the
environmental impacts of salmon aquaculture) are portrayed in mediated environmental
conflict contributes to the politicisation of science and the efficacy of public debate
(Maeseele, 2017). While science information in this case is used by government, industry,
opposition groups and journalists in attempt to gain a position of power in environmental
conflict, scientists themselves lack such power in Tasmanian media debates.
Leith et al. (2014b) concludes that during policy conflict science communication plays a key
role in supporting a virtuous cycle, by having stakeholders with perceived impartial expertise
inject information about prominent topics in the public discourse of Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture, taking into account the structure of the problem (see also Monteiro, 2017,
Jasanoff, 2017, Gluckman, 2015, Palliser and Dodson, 2019, Yang et al., 2015). However, for
those actors entering public environmental conflict, they do so with no confidence about how
they will be perceived. Nonetheless, it is argued that not actively contributing to media
debate is â€œa riskier strategyâ€ (Lester and Foxwell-Norton, 2020: 114). Lester and Foxwell
Norton explain that:
whether scientists themselves are present or not, their data will be used by the key actorsâ€”
media, industry, government, and campaignersâ€”and will become a source of contention
in itself. When the data is not accompanied into the public domain by its scientific creators
and proponents, it is prone to politicisationâ€”rendering futile any decision on the part of
scientists to deliberately stay out of public debate so as not to politicise their work. (2020:
114)
Here the â€œtumultuousâ€ relationship between science and media (Besley and Tanner, 2011:
241) and science and decision-making (Sarewitz, 2004) are evident. This disconnect between 8 | Discussion
206
scientists and the presentation of the information they produce has consequences for how
scientific information is used and perceived in not only environmental conflict but
environmental governance. In the Tasmanian case, uncertainty was created concerning the
independence, relevance, and role of science in informing opposition campaigns, corporate
decisions, and government regulations regarding the environmental impact of the industry.
The findings from this thesis combined with that of other case studies presented by Lester
(2019: 115) speaks to scientists not participating as political actors â€“ that â€œwhen politicisation
of science is entrenched within a conflict, scientistsâ€™ involvement, along with that of their
data, is rarely presented as that of a key actor who is able to actuate switching points within
mediatised environmental conflictâ€, whereby power is transferred between actors. Further
exploration of the apparent absence of scientists in mediated environmental debate could
reveal nuances regarding the communications and institutional pathways and barriers in
evidence-based decision-making where public debate is heightened.
Additionally, wanting to acknowledge the shift from â€˜theâ€™ media to media, extensions of this
study could examine how readers receive environmental science information. News sites are
increasingly focusing on â€˜shareableâ€™ content (Heimbach and Hinz, 2018) and the presence of
environmental science information in social media needs further research to complement this
work. For instance, investigating what news stories get â€˜sharedâ€™ on social media could
contribute to understanding what information is circulated beyond news media. Do the
narratives in news media and social media align? And how is environmental science perceived
and used across different media platforms? This speaks to the science-public-policy
interface.8 | Discussion
207
8.3.6 Broadening the theory of mediatised environmental conflict to
encompass science and scientists in communicative
environmental risk governance
This research brings to the fore the role or lack thereof of environmental science and science
communication in the mediatised environmental conflicts framework. The thesis findings
suggest that it is pertinent to expand the theory of mediatised environmental conflict to
include environmental science and science communication in order to usefully examine
environmental conflict within social ecological systems. Accordingly, how mediatised
environmental conflict unfolds is determined by the interaction between â€œ(i) activist
strategies and campaigns, (ii) journalism practices and news reporting, (iii) formal politics and
decision-making processes, â€¦ (iv) industry activities and tradeâ€ (Hutchins and Lester, 2015)
and (v) environmental science and science communication. However, because the theory is
about who has power, not who should have power, this reworked version of mediatised
environment conflict represents an ideal scenario whereby scientists have power in
environmental conflict. The relationship between the four stakeholder groups (activists,
journalists, politicians and government and industry) and science should be considered in the
context of media and environmental conflict, however this research demonstrates that
science is not yet the key player it should be or even claims to be in public environmental
conflict. This thesis considers why scientists donâ€™t have power in the case of Tasmanian
environmental conflict over salmon aquaculture and how they might obtain it in public
debates.
Much of the literature discussing the outward communications of science information relates
to the science-policy interface with the goal of policy and decision-making processes being
informed by the most relevant and current scientific knowledge (Posner and Cvitanovic, 2019, 8 | Discussion
208
Sternlieb et al., 2013). It is also acknowledged that decisions may not necessarily follow the
recommendations of environmental science due to the consideration of other information
(Gregory et al., 2016). Therefore, it is not only the accountability of the environmental science
and risk assessment in question here but also the transparency of governments to ensure
stakeholders understand how this science information is placed within multifaceted decision
making (Kania and Kramer, 2011). This thesis reinforces the notion that while science can
measure the environmental impact of a given practice, what is considered acceptable
environmental risk is socially and politically constructed. In complex socio-ecological
problems the capacity to deal with scientific uncertainty and clearly understanding and
communicating the boundaries and capabilities of science can be greater than the
requirements for specific technical advice. Also important is having clear expectations of what
science can and cannot provide in solving socio-ecological problems (Bocking, 2013).
The task of communicating complex scientific knowledge to interested publics
becomes increasingly challenging and complex in politically charged and highly contentious
issues involving a variety of interests, values, attitudes, and beliefs. Efforts to test and
determine how best to communicate complex information in lay terms is a contemporary
research agenda (Kelly, 2020, VanDyke and Lee, 2020). However, in practice, how
environmental science information can and should be communicated to create virtuous
cycles within mediatised environmental conflict remains largely unresolved and unaddressed.
While there have been decades of literature that explores the politicisation of science and
scientists (e.g. Nelkin, 1975, (Jasanoff, 1987, Sarewitz, 2004), Lewenstein (2017: 78) proposes
â€œthat we have not studied scientific and technical controversies enough to find the enduring
patterns. Perhaps we are just at the beginning of study of controversy, and there is much to 8 | Discussion
209
doâ€. Certainly, it has been apparent in this thesis that considerable uncertainty still exists
regarding whose role and responsibility it is to publicly communicate environmental risks
identified by science in the expansion of Tasmanian Salmon farming. In particular, when in
the decision-making process should science information be outwardly disseminated and in
what format?
If it is understood that scientific information is unlikely to override competing interests or
prevail in disputes over values (Nelkin, 1975), then communication of science information
should be accompanied by a clear definition of what has been determined as an acceptable
level of risk in the decision-making process and how this level of risk has been determined.
However, â€˜riskâ€™ is not a single fact nor is there one person or institution in charge of or
responsible for defining â€˜itâ€™ and communicating â€˜itâ€™ to a separate public. Rather, risk is an
understanding that is continually redefined discursively in different contexts. Risk definitions,
and by whom they are defined, is malleable and constantly changing. There are multiple
simultaneous risk definitions and ownership over a singular risk definition is illogical.
Therefore, no singular institution can be in charge of communicating them. Likewise, science
is not independent from politics, even the problems that science seeks to understand are only
considered problems in the context of socially embedded norms, values and interests
(Sarewitz, 2004). Moreover, if the acceptable level of environmental risk is socially
constructed and government decision-making considers a range of information outside of
environmental science, then the role of social scientists and economists could also play a role
in public environmental debates. Hence, the discussion remains focused on how, in a
democracy, do media, science, governance, industry and interested communities all play a
role in understanding, communicating, and managing risk. This sits within current scholarship 8 | Discussion
210
that captures the contemporary contestation of â€˜evidenceâ€™ which Parkhurst (2016) refers to
as the â€œpolitics of evidenceâ€. Here, not only is evidence used and misused within political
areas but what constitutes evidence is also disputed.
Importantly, this thesis does not make a distinction between scientists who are positioned to
provide advice to government and are given agency to directly inform decision-making and
scientists who do not have these formal government support roles. There is also
environmental monitoring commissioned by companies to meet regulatory requirements and
inform industry practice. There are differences in problem framing and communicative
practices that reflect the different drivers of the research. For user driven research the
problem will be limited in scope and communication will be tailored for the end user. When
considering science communication and mediatised environmental conflict within the
broader socio-ecological system this also raises questions regarding the responsibility
scientists have to the natural environment and society.
The findings of this thesis suggest that the field of science communication in mediatised
environmental conflict needs to inquire into ways to address concerns of transparency and
independence, keeping in mind the various roles in which scientists operate within. In the
case of environmental risk conflicts, it is worthwhile determining the nuances of science
communication in the public sphere where the discourse over what is acceptable risk is
carried out. Particularly in the context of transparency regarding contentious issues of how
industry uses publicly owned common pool natural resources, such as marine aquaculture.
The thesis reinforces that adjacent to communicating science information it is also important
to outwardly communicate the process for which scientific recommendations, along with a
range of other knowledge, information and interests, are considered in formal decision-8 | Discussion
211
making. Even if stakeholders disagree with the outcome, legitimacy can be gained if they
understand and accept why and how the decision was reached (Smith, 2003). It would be
useful to further investigate the correlation between how environmental scientific
information and values-based interests are applied in claims-making, how these different
forms of knowledge and information are considered within formal regulatory processes and
how these decision-making processes are communicated publicly.
The politicisation of environmental science in the case of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture was
exacerbated by the poorly perceived participatory mechanisms in project-level decision
making in Tasmania. Irrespective of whether or not the decision-making processes of the
Tasmanian government were adequately managing the environment with the information
they had (i.e. environmental impact data, interests of other users of the waters and economic
benefits to regional communities) the government was outwardly opaque in their
communications of these processes. Along with Palliser and Dodson (2019) and Spangenberg
(2011) this research emphasises that increased stakeholder participation in environmental
decision-making is critical in rebuilding trust, but that this must be supported by overall
changes in science and governance systems to improve transparency and accountability.
8.3.7 Broadening the practices of transparency and accountability of
decision-making processes to encompass media
While Leith et al.â€™s (2014b) research focuses on how science can better inform decision
making, the findings presented in this thesis emphasise the need for enhancing the outward
communication of this process. In particular, the communication of how acceptable
environmental risk and impact is determined in government decision-making processes and
how and when science informs this process, along with other interests and knowledges. 8 | Discussion
212
Acceptability addresses the competing narratives of growth versus environment. Here it is
pertinent to note that while scientists can take accountability for their results, it is
government who must take responsibility for the overall decisions. It is not only how media
frame scientific information but also practices of science such as research problem framing
and communicating scientific uncertainty (Bocking, 2012). Greater transparancy of how
science information is considered in the decicion-making process along with other interests
and knowledges could potentially contribute to reducing the degree to which science is
politicised. This thesis suggeststhat it is this nexus between environmental science, social and
political definitions of acceptable environmental risk and government decision-making that if
given greater transparency could contribute to virtuous cycles within socioecological debates.
However, it is important to reiterate that discourses will always compete and there is no single
â€˜correctâ€™ outcome. Transparency is unlikely to be the only remedy for entrenched
socioecological conflicts.
The importance of transparency â€“ paired with accountability (Seligsohn et al., 2018) â€“
regarding the process, impacts and outcomes of corporate and government practices has a
long history in the environmental governance and corporate social responsibility literature
(e.g. Steurer, 2010). The importance of transparency and accountability acting together is
emphasised by Seligsohn et al. (2018) by explaining that â€œin the absence of a mechanism for
the public to hold local government accountable, public transparency alone has no impact on
outcomes other than information provision itselfâ€. Adequate transparency of process and
outcomes provides the foundations for accountability, key pillars of democratic values
(Bovens, 2007, Grimmelikhuijsen and Welch, 2012, Hood, 2006, Kjaer, 2004).
Grimmelikhuijsen and Welch (2012: 563) defines transparency as â€œthe disclosure of 8 | Discussion
213
information by an organization that enables external actors to monitor and assess its internal
workings and performanceâ€ which â€œtypically incorporates multiple components, including
inward observability, active disclosure, and external assess ability â€œ. The findings of this thesis
also point to the possibility that scientists clearly communicating results that are used in
government decision-making and government transparency regarding the decision-making
process could facilitate virtuous debates regarding the environmental risks of aquaculture.
However, this should be placed within a critical assessment of media roles, politics and power
which should be given active consideration in how discourses work to shape reality and
different agendas.
The link between the quality of government communications and the presence of public
conflict has been acknowledged for decades (for example Beierle and Konisky, 2000). The
perceived ambiguity regarding governance and management processes has been a legacy of
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture sectorâ€™s development, with government processes found to
be seen as lacking legitimacy and transparency in Leith et al.â€™s (2014b) work. This ambiguity
concerned inadequate distribution of information and exclusion of community concerns by
government and industry in planning and management processes. This speaks to the
importance of a two-way accessibility component of transparency whereby â€œstakeholders
have access to government processes and the government has access to stakeholder valuesâ€
(Drew and Nyerges, 2004: 43). Perceived issues of governance and the failure of regulatory
mechanisms, along with the dominant environmental risk framing evident in this research is
also prominent in media representations of salmon aquaculture around the world (Schlag,
2011, Olsen and Osmundsen, 2017). The consistency of this finding across salmon aquaculture
regions indicates that there is an identified need and opportunity for stakeholders involved 8 | Discussion
214
in the governance and management of fin-fish aquaculture to develop proactive, transparent
and engaging communication of governance processes. The requirement for greater
transparency of State Government decision-making, particularly concerning clear, accessible,
timely and regular information regarding environmental management, also has a long history
in other aquaculture sectors in Australia (Mazur and Curtis, 2008). Transparent and proactive
communication of decision-making processes could improve the likelihood of the level of civic
and policy dialogue and debate and its legitiamcy. According to the research in this thesis, this
might include outward promotion of 1) the mechanisms for which different information (e.g.,
environmental data and community interests) is collected, processed and considered in
decision-making processes and 2) how these mechanisms address common issues in media
discourse (e.g. environmental risk, economic growth and regulation). Drew and Nyerges
(2004) conceptualise this as â€˜decision transparencyâ€™ whereby the steps taken to reach a
decision and rationale behind the decision are accessible, accurate, clear and presented in
relation to the broader problem context. The process stipulates stakeholder involvement and
accountability. Other points for which government can adopt transparency include policy
content â€“ what measures are adopted and how they solve a problem â€“ and policy outcomes
â€“ what effect has the policy had (Heald, 2006).
Media, in this case, play a role in publicised negotiations for defining acceptability. If what is
considered acceptable environmental risk of expansion of salmon aquaculture has been
determined without adequate transparency of processes, then conflict in media is publicly
highlighting the decision-space (what is up for negotiation). If the decision-space is small then
public participation is limited (Walker, 2015), potentially leading to vicious cycles. In this
instance, media may play an important role in a deliberative democracy by attempting to 8 | Discussion
215
open up decision spaces and therefore participation. However, when interviewees were
seeking transparent and reflexive public dialogue on both local and global scales, the presence
of journalists was explicitly prohibited. There was a systemic fear of mainstream news media
expressed by interviewees. This is an expression of the power struggles between media and
key stakeholders. While public debate is vital for deliberative democracy it does not negate
the importance of ensuring it serves the public interest. Uncertainties, knowledge gaps and
diverse values, interests, perspectives and understandings are normal (Palliser and Dodson,
2019). To conceal these in public dialogue limits the ability for publics to make informed
judgements. Yet, media representation of government processes portrayed a lack of
reflexivity and adaptability in decision-making processes, regardless of the adequacy of the
processes. The nexus of media, environmental campaigning, environmental science and
decision-making and the notion of informed public debates2 as evidenced in this thesis
emphasised that outward communication of government processes is just as important as the
processes themselves.
With the rise of deliberative democracy (Brooks et al., 2020) and collaborative approaches to
natural resource management (Walker, 2015), transparency of â€œwhat knowledge gets
counted as valid is as important as the knowledge itselfâ€ (Lindenfeld et al., 2012: pp. 29 citing
Latour, 2004). Deliberative democracy is built on the notion that â€œthose affected by collective
decisions should have the right, capacity and opportunity to participate in the making of those
decisionsâ€ (Schirmer et al., 2016:citing Cohen 1989). The main promise of deliberative
democracy (compared to representative democracy) is to achieve a shared sense of
2 Bozeman and Johnson (2015) identify the following as â€œpublic values criteria; creation, maintenance, and
enhancement of the public sphere; progressive opportunity; mechanisms for values articulation and
aggregation; avoiding monopolies; sufficient transparency for public to make informed judgements; distribution
of benefits; long term time-horizons; conservation of resources; and ensure subsistence and human dignityâ€.8 | Discussion
216
legitimacy between stakeholders, even in the most challenging and polarising of value
conflicts, whilst acknowledging that it cannot â€œmake incompatible values compatibleâ€
(Gutmann and Thompson, 2004: 11). This view inherently focuses on processes rather than
outcomes, providing lessons for future conflicts over common pool natural resources. While
the literature clearly acknowledges the importance of transparency of processes and such a
conclusion might appear obvious and unremarkable, the efficacy of communicating this in
practice is still lacking. By investigating mediatised environmental conflicts and how local and
transnational discourses interact, there can be a move towards identifying and establishing
the opportunities that may begin to reduce the gap between knowledge and practice in
contentious issues.
This study lays the foundations for further research regarding what the potential role of media
is in how democracy interacts with environmental governance. While social conflict is an
important and integral part of social process and decision-making about managing natural
resources, media discourse can expose areas of governance structures that create tensions
(Bengston and Fan, 1999). For example, because salmon farms are governed by the local
municipalities in Norway, the local community directly experiences the benefits from a fee
paying industry. This could explain why Norwegian government and industry did not need to
promote a local benefits narrative, unlike Tasmania. Also, traditional owners were not visible
in Tasmania or Norway news media discourse, yet they have a considerable presence in
debates over salmon aquaculture in Canada (Young and Matthews, 2010). Additionally,
concerns of a lack of sufficient transparency in government and corporate processes and
environmental impacts are still prevalent in media claims in the case of Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture. There remain contemporary questions regarding the concept, such as: what is 8 | Discussion
217
considered adequate transparency? How does transparency shift with context and scale? And
what role can media play in the transparency of complex natural resource management? For
example, when companies go beyond what is stipulated by third-party certification or
regulatory requirements, analysis of media discourse could provide a proxy for the issues they
need to be proactively transparent about. Media could also have a greater role to play in
relaying digestible information regarding how decisions are made.
This study has revealed areas for further investigation with regard to the link between
science, publics and decision-making in mediatised environmental conflict. For example, what
does this imply for how â€˜evidenceâ€™ is portrayed in risk communication, interpretation, and
decision-making? Because different discourses work to shape reality in different ways for
different agendas, the role of media and politics should be actively considered in these types
of debates. Having a critical view of media, politics and power is imperative for these
contributions to improve policy process and public information. For example, what
mechanisms are available for stakeholders and concerned citizens to communicate risk
definitions in the government decision-making process regarding industry expansion (for
example see van Putten et al., 2018)? And are these mechanisms perceived to be adequate
and by who? If they are in fact considered adequate then it could confirm that enhancing
(clear, regular and proactive) public communication of decision-making processes could
facilitate virtuous cycles. If not, then it could indicate areas of improvement for how and
when environmental, social and economic information is gathered and considered in the
management of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry.
Further research would be useful to confirm whether it is a governance failure or a failure of
communicating said governance (and the perception of this process), or a combination of 8 | Discussion
218
these, that sparks conflicts. This thesis addresses the need to be specific as to how
communication pathways (not just media) can be used to contribute to environmental
governance (government, corporate and market) outcomes that are in the public
interest (Bozeman and Johnson, 2015: 67). Interviewees in Australia and Norway suggest that
communication departments of government and industry are undergoing a growth period to
accommodate this new communications model and is an emerging area to assess. 9 | Conclusion

CONCLUDING REMARKS9 | Conclusion
220
This research places environmental risk negotiations at the nexus of science information,
community interests, industry expansion and impacts and government decision-making
within a critical assessment of media roles, politics and power. It gives active consideration to
how discourses work to shape reality and different agendas. The thesis builds upon the overall
understanding of the mediatisation of environmental conflict, the politicisation of knowledge
and information and the flow of environmental governance and risk discourses at different
temporal and spatial scales. The principal concern of the thesis has been to ask how the
environmental risks of common pool natural resource use, particularly Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture, are articulated and negotiated via processes of media and communications,
both locally and transnationally. When seeking to contribute to the understanding of the
public negotiations of natural resource management across time and scale it is easy to retreat
to the local, providing neat boundaries and context. However, this is not possible if the aim is
to explore how the local and transnational interact. Asking questions regarding local and
transnational flows of sustainability, risk, ideas, trade, investment, and governance requires
new approaches to investigate how we understand the world. This thesis investigated these
complexities using media analysis, expert interviews, direct observation and peer reviewed
literature review to provide insight into the complex and multi-directional nexus between
media, public and policy across time and scale. By bringing together the literature on
environmental governance and media in the context of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, it is
evident that conceptualisation of the dynamics and dimensions of environmental conflict and
governance benefits from considering mediatisation and its transnational dimensions.
While this research contributes empirically to the fields of environmental communication,
media studies and environmental governance literature by conducting an in-depth study of a 9 | Conclusion
221
globally significant case study in aquaculture, the research limitations need to be considered.
These include data collection constraints such as a potentially non-representative interview
sample, access to interviewees limiting participation and the lack of (language) ability for
analysis of Asian and Norwegian news texts. To limit the impacts on the findings the research
approach triangulated the data sources and combined analysis techniques to provide depth
and breadth in knowledge.
By empirically investigating the claims and counter-claims in news media regarding the
environmental risks of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, and seafood more broadly when
appropriate, the thesis makes several novel contributions. Firstly, it conducts the first known
in-depth study of the public debates in media of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry and
how these local discourses interact with transnational flows of trade and production. By doing
so it answers the research questions by uncovering the dominant discourse presented in the
news media coverage of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, by who were these discourse
themes carried, how these local conflicts interact with transnational discourses of
environmental sustainability and the role of media in these mediatised processes. This has
culminated in the following key findings:
The thesis has confirmed that environmental conflicts are reinforced by divergent scientific,
social and political definitions of acceptable environmental risk and sustainability and
inadequate transparency of how these definitions are formed. Discourse of salmon
aquaculture within the Tasmanian news media was predominantly framed regarding
environmental risk of industry expansion and the adequacy of government regulation. First
identified in Chapter 5 and confirmed in Chapter 7 is that complex risk discourses were being
simplified in news media into a binary tension between environmental impact and economic 9 | Conclusion
222
prosperity. Environmental science and community interests were conflated within these
discourses, particularly concerning transparency of information and knowledge and how
these were used in decision-making processes. Subsequently there was visible contestation
over knowledge, who carries it and when is it considered legitimate. This is reflected by the
ambiguous and subjective interpretation of environmental sustainability and best practice in
the claims of different stakeholders.
It cannot be assumed that global scale discourse will automatically transfer to local contexts
and the interaction between global and local is important to consider. Claims and counter
claims regarding environmental sustainability and best practice are themes that are most
strongly placed within transnational flows. The disconnect between local and global
definitions of environmental sustainability and best practice and the conflicts and confusion
this creates between claims-makers and decisions-makers has been highlighted in this thesis.
This suggests that different interpretations of environmental sustainability are at the heart of
the stakeholder conflicts at both local and international levels. While broad themes of
environmental challenge and risks associated with the expansion and continued economic
prosperity of the salmon aquaculture sector can transfer globally, subthemes of risk are not
as easily transferable between growing regions.
There is a high level of adaptability and reflexivity required to engage and operate in
complex and dynamic issues of sustainability across scales and this is broadly lacking in
governance, media and science. Brought to the forefront is the importance, and at times
difficulty, of acknowledging and attempting to reconcile between local and international
standards regarding acceptable environmental risk and the limitations of standards as the
only metric for sustainability. This research suggests that government, salmon companies and 9 | Conclusion
223
science institutions could hold the most leverage to influence the public discourse and
therefore facilitate virtuous cycles. However, in the case of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
these stakeholders were portrayed in news media to be outwardly ambiguous in their
communications of decision-making processes or their involvement in these processes.
Environmental opposition groups had relatively low visibility in Australian news media. This is
not to say that environmental campaigning organisations have not provided the foundations
for corporate players to use the environmental discourse. However, it exemplifies a shift in
the traditional role of ENGOs in holding industries and governments to account to industry.
Subsequently, the priorities supporting this environmental discourse favours the interests
and motives held by companies.
The interactions between industry, government and journalist stakeholders and opposition
groups show that power is linked with scientific understanding. This research brings to the
fore the absence of environmental science and science communication in the mediatised
environmental conflicts theory. Because the theory is about who has power, not who should
have power, the theory is currently accurate in its disregard of science. This research
demonstrates that science is not yet the key player it should be or even claims to be in public
environmental conflict. However, the relationship between the four stakeholder groups in
the mediatised environmental conflict theory (activists, journalists, politicians and
government and industry) and science should be considered in the context of media and
environmental conflict. In an ideal scenario science does have power in environmental
conflict and therefore would have a rightful place in the theory of mediatised environmental
conflict. Accordingly, how mediatised environmental conflict unfolds should be determined
by the interaction between â€œ(i) activist strategies and campaigns, (ii) journalism practices and 9 | Conclusion
224
news reporting, (iii) formal politics and decision-making processes, â€¦ (iv) industry activities
and tradeâ€ (Hutchins and Lester, 2015) and (v) environmental science and science
communication. However, science must earn the fifth spot by accessing more power within
processes of mediatisation. By considering why scientists donâ€™t have power in the case of
Tasmanian environmental conflict over salmon aquaculture this thesis has been able to
contribute to how they might obtain power in public debates. Science information has a
critical role in the management of common pool natural resource use. However, science
cannot provide clear guidelines for, or likely consequences of, government decision, creating
tension at the science-policy-public interface. The role of scientists and their information in
defining environmental risk, and how this information interacts with other information and
knowledges can be a source of contention and should be given attention in communications
theory.
Greater transparancy of how science information is considered in the decision-making
process along with other interests and knowledges could potentially contribute to reducing
the degree to which science is politicised. The framing of science in environmental
controversies in media is determined by a range of external factors such as competing
newsworthy events, economic and political conditions and the perceptions of credibility. It is
not only how media frame scientific information but also practices of science such as research
problem framing and communicating scientific uncertainty (Bocking, 2012). This thesis
reinforces the notion that while science can measure the environmental impact of a given
production practice, what is considered acceptable environmental risk is socially and
politically constructed. Yet, the representation of government processes in media portrayed 9 | Conclusion
225
a lack of reflexivity and adaptability in decision-making processes, regardless of the adequacy
of the processes.
The nexus of media, environmental campaigning, environmental science and decision
making and the notion of informed public debates as evidenced in this thesis has
emphasised that outward communication of government processes is just as important as
the processes themselves. In the case of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, what is considered
acceptable environmental risk of expansion in the decision-making process has been
determined without adequate transparency of processes. The lack of trustworthy decision
making processes in Tasmania was reinforced by the perceived ambiguity regarding the
mechanisms for which different interests and knowledges were sought and considered in the
formal decision-making process. This likely could contribute to virtuous cycles within
socioecological debates.
Importantly, the thesis reinforces the importance of paring transparency with
accountability to ensure information provision is carried into a virtuous cycle of
negotiations. Clear proactive communication of decision-making processes in media and
other relevant communications channels (case dependant) could improve the likelihood of
the level of civic and policy dialogue and debate and its legitiamcy. According to the research
in this thesis, this might include outward promotion of 1) the mechanisms for which different
information (e.g. environmental data and community interests) is collected, processed and
considered in decision-making processes and 2) how these mechanisms address common
issues in media discourse (e.g. environmental risk, economic growth and regulation).
However, it is important to reiterate that discourses will always compete and there is no single 9 | Conclusion
226
â€˜correctâ€™ outcome. Therefore, transparency is unlikely to be the only remedy for entrenched
socioecological conflicts.
Analysing the mediatised conflict concerning the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry has
exposed entrenched vicious cycles that have prevailed since Leith et alâ€™s work in 2014b and
how they are portrayed to the public. This can inform processes of risk framing and potential
opportunities for conflict resolution between state and non-state stakeholders. Attention to
the outward communication of processes, rather than outcomes, can identify opportunities
to reduce the gap between knowledge and practice in contentious issues. Understanding the
mediatised environmental conflict of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture and how these
interact with transnational flows of transnational flows of sustainability, risk, ideas, trade, and
governance has been useful in identifying factors that contribute to virtuous cycles within
socioecological debates and opportunities for creating virtuous ones.
While the aim of the conclusion chapter is to clearly and succinctly summarise the key findings
and recommendations regarding media, communication and governance, it remains that it is
no one personâ€™s or institutionâ€™s (including media) role or responsibility to define and
communicate risk. Who defines risk at different spacial and temporal scales, in which context
and for whom is fluid and complex. â€˜Riskâ€™ is not a single fact nor is there one institution in
charge of â€˜communicating itâ€™ to a separate public, but rather risk is an understanding that is
continually redefined discursively in different contexts. Media, science, government
regulations, industry, environmental campaigning, third-party certification and various and
diverse publics all have a role to play in understanding, negotiating and managing risk. How
this occurs transnationally is purposive and actors in the negotiations need to be acutely
aware of the local-global interaction and the associated implications and opportunities. 9 | Conclusion
227
It is likely that the anthropogenic pressure on natural resources will continue and economic
and environmental sustainability will remain at odds. While the findings and discussions
within this research are of direct relevance to the salmon aquaculture sector, particularly in
Tasmania, the lessons could be usefully applied to other cases of private/commercial use or
development of common pool (publicly owned) natural resources, particularly in multi-use
areas and resources (in this case the highly contested coastal zone). The transnational flow of
personnel, investment, resources and information is expected to increase and congregate in
the Australia-Asia region. Those involved in the enactment of environmental conflict should
reflect on the circumstances for which conflict was built upon and the implications for
environmental governance. The contemporary areas of contention around accountability,
transparency, reflexivity, adaptability, and inclusion presented in this thesis and the nexus
between publics, policy and media highlight the complexity of claims-making and decision
making in current environmental conflicts. Defining risk cannot be achieved by any one
individual, group or institution at any one location. Everyone has a role to play in creating
virtuous negotiations of environmental risk. 10 | References

ABSTRACT
This paper analyses mediatised environmental conflflict over the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry's performance. It compares the Senate Inquiry into the
â€œRegulation of the fifin-fifish aquaculture industry in Tasmaniaâ€, the inflfluential Four Corners investigative journalism television program â€˜Big Fishâ€™ and news media
coverage following each of these mediatised public investigations. The concept of â€œmediatised environmental conflflictâ€ is applied to reveal how these difffferent modes
of investigation inflfluence public debate. Both the Senate Inquiry and the Four Corners program allowed previously invisible actors and networks to be made visible,
while rendering others largely silent, particularly scientists despite strong references to science within the debate. Also, the traditional role of ENGOs in holding
industries and Governments to account has shifted in this case to an industry player. Considerable difffferences in the discourses was observed, raising further
questions concerning accountability and transparency in public-policy decision-making in relation to management of marine resources.
1. Introduction
In 2015/2016, the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry ap
peared to lose what it had previously referred to as its enviable â€˜social
licenseâ€™ [1]. The industry had earned this (perceived) â€˜community ac
ceptanceâ€™ (at the local level) and â€˜socio-political acceptanceâ€™ (at the
broader level) [2] over the previous decades by bringing new and re
nowned industry to the otherwise economically struggling southern
island state of Australia. Importantly, it had done this with few visible
impacts on the much fought over Tasmanian environment, about 20 per
cent of which is listed as wilderness World Heritage and 135,100 ha of
Marine Protected Areas. The conflflict largely became visible to the
public through two mediatised events â€“ a Senate Inquiry into the
â€œregulation of the fifin-fifish aquaculture industry in Tasmaniaâ€ and a
piece of investigative journalism broadcast by the ABC on its flflagship
current affffairs program Four Corners, the episode titled â€œBig Fishâ€.
Following these events, the conflflict was further entrenched by, and
continues as, key legal and political undertakings between key actors.
This paper investigates the role that media plays in framing the
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry and subsequently the role
these frames played in the public debate as having important con
sequences for policy and resource management. This study compares a
formal Government (the Senate Inquiry) and informal journalistic (Four
Corners program) mode of Inquiry into aquaculture governance, in
cluding subsequent news media coverage, with a focus on the
following:
1) What discourse frames are present within news media following
these investigations?
2) Who are the prominent actors present in media discourse following
these investigations (and those that are absent) and how are they
were portrayed?
3) How does this inflfluence the operating environment for claims-ma
kers and decision-makers in environmental governance and how
difffferent stakeholders engage as political actors?
This paper answers these questions through the lens of â€˜mediatisa
tionâ€™, particularly â€˜mediatised environmental conflflictâ€™, that approaches
environmental disputes as an interaction between various actors and
how these interactions come together to change the course of the dis
courses and outcomes of the conflflict [3]. In doing so, it expands both
empirical and theoretical understanding of how media inflfluences public
debate through representations of claims-makers and decision-makers,
and of their claims, under diffffering modes of public Inquiry - the Senate
Inquiry and Four Corners program. It is expected that the Senate inquiry
and Four Corners would take difffferent approaches to examining what is
traditionally evidence-based environmental governance of salmon, and
that the response to these two types of investigations in the public
sphere would also diffffer. In particular, this research is interested in
analysing the role of scientists as political actors in publicised issues of

Tenvironmental management. The analysis of these investigations, and
the interactions and responses in news coverage that they facilitate and
promote, also asks what implications these claims-making and dis
course-shaping processes have for accountability and transparency in
public policy and management of environmental resources.
Aquaculture is a growth industry and will continue to supply the
rising demand for fifish for human consumption while capture fifisheries
remain relatively stable. By 2030 the aquaculture sector is predicted to
supply 62% of fifish for human consumption [4]. While salmon aqua
culture is only one species which is generally marketed to the upper
middle class consumer it provides a timely and opportune case to ex
amine key environmental and social licence debates that underpin
public discourse concerning food production.
To begin, this paper fifirst outlines the context for the growth and
current status of the salmon aquaculture industry in Tasmania, and the
conditions leading to the emergence of conflflict. It then provides back
ground to the concept of mediatisation as it is understood in relation to
environmental conflflict, before outlining the methods deployed for our
analysis. This paper examines the Senate Inquiry and Four Corners
episode â€œBig Fishâ€, and the news coverage generated by each, with a
focus on the presence and roles of key frames and actors. To conclude, it
discusses the implications for how ENGOs, salmon companies and sci
entists engage as political actors in difffferent discourse contexts and the
media's role in constructing these contexts.
1.1. Background
Three main companies farm salmon in Tasmania: Tassal, the largest
of the three, is a publicly listed company; Huon Aquaculture, a family
founded company that flfloated 30% on the ASX in 2014; and Petuna, the
smallest of the three is family founded and has not publicly listed. The
industry has the been the focus of various environmental conflflicts [see
5â€“7] particularly since recent plans to signifificantly expand the industry
[8] with a goal of doubling production by 2030. This growth agenda is
also shared and supported by the Tasmanian Government [9].
Years of expansion, regulatory changes and concerns of amenity and
environmental impact preceded the Four Corners program. This tension
was carried through a range of events leading up to and following Four
Corners (Fig. 1).
In 2012, the industry's application to expand the farming practices
in Macquarie Harbour was approved. As a precaution, the proposed
expansion was staged. Following increases in the stocking limit, initial
concerns regarding the environmental carrying capacity of the harbour
were identifified in 2014 [10]. At this point the State Government at the
time changed the management scheme in the harbour from biomass
limits to a percentage given to each company, resulting in a larger al
location to Tassal. The conflflict between companies was observable from
this moment. In September 2014 an email written by Petuna and Huon
Aquaculture addressed to the Tasmanian Premier and Minister for
Primary Industries and Water along with senior bureaucrats within the
Tasmanian Government detailing concerns of high stocking rates,
environmental impacts and inadequate regulatory approaches to
managing these issues was leaked to the Greens political party. In
particular was the concern that Tassal was going to exceed their
stocking limit. This in itself was a critical moment in the discourse that
led to the Senate Inquiry.
In the State Parliament, the then Greens party leader, Kim Booth,
tabled the leaked email sent from Huon Aquaculture and Petuna to the
Tasmanian Premier, Will Hodgman, (who declared the Inquiry a â€œwitch
huntâ€ [11]. Following this, Greens Party Senator Peter Wish-Wilson
proposed the Senate Inquiry into the matter and reduction in the
salmon stocking limits to represent pre-expansion numbers. On 24
March 2015 the Senate referred the matter of the â€œregulation of the fifin-
fifish aquaculture industry in Tasmaniaâ€ for Inquiry with a report due by
21 August 2015. The hearings were conducted on July 15â€“16 2015 to
investigate;
(a) â€œthe adequacy and availability of data on waterway health;
(a) the impact on waterway health, including to threatened and en
dangered species;
(a) the adequacy of current environmental planning and regulatory
mechanisms;
(a) the interaction of state and federal laws and regulation;
(a) the economic impacts and employment profifile of the industry; and
(a) any other relevant matters.â€ [12]
The Committee advertised the Inquiry on their website and in the
national newspaper, The Australian, and also wrote directly to what
they considered relevant organisations and individuals inviting sub
missions by 1 June 2015. The Committee received 103 submissions of
which 15 were confifidential. Anyone could make a submission to the
Senate Inquiry.
There is evidence to suggest that the apparent environmental and
regulatory issues in Macquarie Harbour have increased levels of mis
trust among parts of the Tasmanian community in the industry and
State Government to effffectively mitigate environmental impacts of
salmon aquaculture. This is most notable in areas in the close vicinity of
proposed salmon farms. The mistrust has provided grounding for op
position groups to express their concerns of environmental impact
pertaining to expansion of the industry, as demonstrated in the fol
lowing excerpt from the Hobart Mercury:
The proposal [for Okehampton Bay] comes at a controversial time
for the industry, with community concern about allegations of en
vironmental problems in Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast and
plans by salmon rival Tassal for a fifish farm at Okehampton Bay on
the East coast [13].

Marine Policy 100 (2019) 307â€“315
308Community opposition to Tassal's expansion into Okehampton Bay
on Tasmania's East coast, a previously unfarmed region, was made in
creasingly apparent in early 2016. A local opposition group, Marine
Protection Tasmania, was formed in response to Tassal's expansion into
Okehampton Bay. Another opposition group, Let's Grow Tasmania's
Future, was responsible for an advertisement distributed on TV, their
website and Facebook page, beginning its online presence approxi
mately two months following the Four Corners program. The industry's
expansion in Macquarie Harbour and Okehampton Bay has raised
concerns among some locally-based companies, sections of local com
munities, and environmental organisations, prompting greater atten
tion to the regulation and environmental impacts of the industry.
In mid 2016, responsibility for environmental regulation of the
Tasmanian salmon industry was shifted to the Environmental
Protection Authority (EPA) in response to concerns regarding the in
dependence of the State Government (acting as both the proponent and
regulator of the salmon industry) identifified from the Senate Inquiry. At
the same time, Macquarie Harbour's stocking cap was further increased
[14].
The conflflict, embedded in the rich environmentally antagonistic
political history of Tasmania [see 15,16], reached new heights of con
tention between the salmon industry, political decision makers, ENGOs
and science providers in late 2016 with a dedicated ABC Four Corners
investigative journalism program. Ms Rosalie Woodruffff, the Marine
Environment Spokesperson for the Greens political party states that
â€œthe scale of revelations from the Four Corners exposÃ© on salmon
farming was immense.â€ [17]. She praised the Four Corners program in
an article in the Hobart Mercury, the main local newspaper, for publicly
addressing the perceived failings of sections of the industry.
The program instigated a social media frenzy and almost tripled
news media attention. Four Corners is an inflfluential investigative jour
nalism program aired nationally on television by the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The TV program, dedicating an hour
long segment to the salmon aquaculture industry in Tasmania, aired on
31st October 2016. The program focused on salmon farming at two of
the three farming regions; Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast
(which was the focus of the Senate Inquiry) and Okehampton Bay on
the East Coast, both close to world heritage and marine protected areas.
The program interviewed the following: representatives of two of the
three main salmon companies; a representative of a salmon feed com
pany; an American lawyer; a Melbourne-based scientist; a Tasmanian
mussel farmer; representatives of two Tasmanian ENGOs (Environment
Tasmania, a historically prominent environmental campaign organisa
tion in Tasmania, and Marine Protection Tasmania a relatively newer
organisation); representative of one transnational ENGO (WWF); and
various community members.
In early 2017 Huon Aquaculture sued the State and Federal
Governments for not adequately and fairly managing the harbour. This
was an unprecedented move for a company to publicly and legally
condemn its own industry and regulator for environmental impacts.
1.1.1. Senate Inquiry into the regulation of the fifin-fifish aquaculture industry
in Tasmania
The Senate Inquiry consisted of a period open to public written
submissions, a two day hearing process (15th and 16th July 2015) and a
fifinal report. The majority of submissions to the Senate Inquiry were
made by local residents and businesses. This highlighted the struggle at
the site of production between benefifits arising from the business and
jobs that the salmon farms create and the impact on amenity and access
to the waterways for local residents. Both national and regional ENGOs
and Government agencies also made a number of submissions and,
along with local residents and other marine industries, identifified the
importance of communication from Government and industry, parti
cularly regarding transparency and stakeholder engagement, and con
veyed a range of levels of opinion concerning the adequacy of how
these were undertaken. Anxiety concerning expansion of salmon
farming activity was also expressed and was linked to a perceived lack
of transparency and the high level of support from State Government
for expansion of the industry. Social and economic benefifits and impacts
outweighed the other categories for all key stakeholder groups, how
ever local residents and ENGOs showed greater concern for expansion
compared with other groups.
One of the main outcomes of the Senate Inquiry was the debate that
was instigated concerning the adequacy of environmental regulations
and the tension presented by the Government acting as both proponent
and regulator. In response, the responsibilities of environmental mon
itoring and enforcement were transferred to the EPA. The process of the
Senate Inquiry presented information in a way that transparently
identifified sources and was structured to allow for public decision-ma
kers to respond.
1.1.2. Four Corners â€“ â€œBig Fishâ€
The Four Corners program discussed issues of expansion, lack of
transparency and regulatory rigour and environmental and aesthetic
impacts that were also present in the Senate Inquiry submissions. The
program depicted the salmon industry as â€œpowerfulâ€ and expansion as
something that needs to be â€œreined-inâ€ [18]. The program played a
substantial role in portraying Tassal as a â€œcorporate juggernautâ€ by
revealing a perceived lack of transparency, apparent disregard for the
environment and community mobilisation against the company's East
Coast proposal. Meanwhile, the program portrayed Huon Aquaculture
as the humble, environmentally conscious company and â€œone of Tas
mania's greatest home-grown success storiesâ€. [19].
The Four Corners program highlighted community anxieties con
cerning the expansion of the industry, particularly regarding Tassal's
East Coast farming operations. This appeared to stem from the per
ceived lack of transparency, of Tassal in particular, amplifified in the
program by appearing to uncover internal Tassal documents and com
munications. For the fifirst known time in the public debate concerning
the adequacy of environmental governance of the Tasmanian salmon
industry, the credibility of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the
Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certifification, a third-party
certifification which WWF co-founded, was brought into question. The
risk to the ENGOs reputation was amplifified due to claims made that
their independence was compromised by the accreditation services
work they are paid to do for Tassal. This professional exchange of
services between Tassal and WWF was already publicly disclosed by
both parties prior to Four Corners.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was depicted as
lacking regulatory rigour and ignoring advice from Huon Aquaculture,
Petuna and former Tasmanian salmon farmers regarding the risks to the
marine environment posed by current practices and/or regulations.
Additionally, the program addressed how scientifific knowledge and data
is used by difffferent actors by highlighting the inconsistency in the in
terpretation of both environmental data available and the impact of
salmon farming on the surrounding marine environment. However, the
only scientifific data that was discussed on the program was concerning a
select incident of low dissolved oxygen in Macquarie Harbour, giving
little context of environmental process. This was presented by a scien
tist from Melbourne University. Local scientists who work directly with
the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry and regulators were no
tably absent from the program.
1.2. Mediatisation and mediatised environmental conflflict
Broadly, this paper examines the mediatisation, explained by KÃ¼bler
and Kriesi [20] as â€œthe increase of th[e] inflfluence of the media on
political processes, institutions, organisations and actorsâ€, of in
vestigations and debates into environmental conflflicts. The â€œpreferences
and interestsâ€¦ of (competing) actorsâ€¦are likely to inflfluence the ways
in which the media process and select information they communicate,
and thereby bias the content that is transmitted in media coverage of
C. Cullen-Knox et al.
Marine Policy 100 (2019) 307â€“315
309political processes or eventsâ€ [20: 236]. Hutchins and Lester (2015)
acknowledge that common pool environmental resources attract con-
flflict which is diffiffifficult to solve due to the varying multitude of actors
involved. â€˜Mediatised environmental conflflictâ€™ as theorised by Hutchins
and Lester [3] captures how power is played out in the public sphere
regarding how we use â€“ and impact on â€“ the environment and natural
resources. This emphasizes problems such as â€œwho is affffected, who is
responsible [and] who should respond, and how?â€ [21:1]. Simon Cot
tle's â€˜mediatised conflflictâ€™ identififies media forms as not only avenues for
information dissemination but as resources for a variety of actors to
convey their knowledge, values, and opinions through a public arena
[22]. The information which flflows through these networks also enters
into the political and news discourse of the conflflict. Therefore, the
theory of â€˜mediatised conflflictâ€™ acknowledges that media is entrenched
in the construction of conflflict and asks how the conflflict is conducted.
Hutchins and Lester's theory builds on this by acknowledging the â€œpo
litical signifificance of the environment, and the pivotal role of media in
contests over the defifinition and understanding of environmental risks
and impactsâ€ [3: 341].
While this scholarship presents evidence of the mediatisation pro
cess, some researchers are cautious of the term â€˜mediatisationâ€™ because
it places too much weight on the inflfluence that media has on political
and corporate decision-making [23,24]. This view argues that by em
phasising the role of media one reduces the holistic reality whereby
multiple and wide-ranging elements sway how an issue unfolds. In
contrast, Kriesi [25:155] explain â€œthe media and mediated commu
nication are of central relevance for contemporary societies due to their
decisive inflfluence on, and consequences for, political institutions, po
litical actors and individual citizensâ€.
In applying the theory of â€˜mediatised environmental conflflictsâ€™ [3] to
two key investigations into the Tasmanian salmon farming, this paper
explains how these investigations functioned as critical moments in the
discourse [26]. Power exchange between actors or groups often occurs
around â€˜critical discourse momentsâ€™ [27], where the height of conflflict
often follows key events in the conflflict timeline that changes the course
of the conflflict or reaffiffiffirms the existing trajectory of the discourse. The
concept of â€˜critical discourse momentsâ€™ identififies that there are often
specifific events where the prevailing discourse is contested and multiple
alternative positions are generated. By identifying critical moments in
the discourse more particularly, rich analysis of the difffferent values
positions engaged in issues of debate and conflflict can be conducted.
2. Methods
Two stages of data collection and analysis were undertaken; fifirst,
the submissions to the Senate Inquiry and the Four Corners transcript
underwent separate critical discourse analysis; second, related online
news media in the 6 months following these two investigations were
collected and underwent both content analysis and critical discourse
analysis (see next section). This follows Carvalho's (2007: 226) ap
proach to examining news media, which focuses on â€œchallenges to
discourse constructions of the issueâ€. It allows for organisation of data
that captures, to the greatest degree possible, the various actors and
arguments that are present in the discourse. Applying this methodology
provides insight into how media, ENGOs, scientists, Government, in
dustry and concerned citizens approach and respond to informal and
formal probes into a contentious industry and how difffferent actors are
represented in media, making and responding to claims under difffferent
conditions. This can inform if and how such investigations inflfluence the
operating environment for claims-makers and decision-makers in en
vironmental governance.
Content present on social media was monitored between mid 2016
and early 2018. This included Twitter posts immediately following the
Four Corners program and Facebook pages of opposition groups and
salmon companies. The monitoring identifified methods for commu
nication, claims being made and subsequent interactions between
actors and stakeholder groups. However, due to the limitations of col
lecting and downloading historical social media data [28] formal ana
lysis was not able to be conducted and therefore data from social media
has minimal presence in this paper.
2.1. Data collection
News articles were collected using the Factiva news database,
claiming nearly 33,000 sources of news globally [29]. Search words for
both data sets were: â€œsalmon farmâ€ OR â€œfifish farmâ€ OR â€œsalmon aqua
cultureâ€ OR Tassal OR â€œHuon Aquacultureâ€ OR Petuna. Search criteria
also stipulated Australian sources. The Four Corners dataset comprised
news articles published between 1 November 2016 and 1 May 2017
and, for the Senate Inquiry, between 15 July 2015 and 15 January 2016
(six months following the events). These dates were chosen to capture
the media's representation of the event and how actors responded to
these investigations without overlapping in time. This ensured that the
content of news articles collected following each event was not inflflu
enced by the other.
Submissions to the Senate Inquiry were invited 24 March and due
by June 1 and the Committee's report was submitted 21 August. While
the proceedings of the Senate Inquiry spanned several months, the
public hearings were held on 15 and 16 of July and was used as the
event date for collecting news articles. The Four Corners dataset started
the day after the show aired.
The top fifive news sites that published the most articles for both the
Senate Inquiry and Four Corners were; ABC News (14 and 49),
Launceston Examiner (10 and 28), Burnie Advocate (21 and 37), Hobart
Mercury (13 and 98) and The Australian (0 and 7). Other news outlets
primarily published fifinancial updates (e.g. share prices) or stories
concerning other fifish farming operations around Australia. These fifive
news outlets were therefore considered the most representative data
sources for investigating the Tasmanian salmon farming debate and
articles published by these news outlets were included in the analysis.
The Hobart Mercury and The Australian are both owned by News
Corp Australia. The Hobart Mercury covers Tasmania's south and claims
to reach an average of 94,000 readers of the print version and 350,000
unique visitors each month on digital platforms [30] with 52,683 fol
lowers on Facebook and 15,000 followers on Twitter. The Australian is a
national newspaper, claiming an average of 489,000 with just over
123,000 daily unique visitors to the mobile site [31] with 804,527
followers on Facebook and 659,000 on Twitter. The Burnie Advocate
and the Launceston Examiner are both owned by Fairfax Regional
Media. The Advocate focuses on news from the North-West and West of
Tasmania, claiming a combined print and digital monthly readership of
171,000 [32] with 175,000 followers on Facebook. The Examiner
covers northern Tasmania, claiming a combined print and digital
monthly readership of 204,000 [33] with 51,348 following on Face
book and 12,400 followers on Twitter. The ABC uses a variety of
platforms including tv and radio, however for the purposes of analysis
the online based news was collected. The ABC claim that in the
2016â€“2017 fifinancial year â€œthe average monthly reach of ABC Online in
Australia was 7.7 million, or 39% of online Australian [34]. The na

2.2. Text analysis
Content and critical discourse analysis was conducted by applying
C. Cullen-Knox et al.
Marine Policy 100 (2019) 307â€“315
310inductive qualitative coding whereby qualitative data was organised
and coded into conceptual categories using Nvivo 11 software (QSR
International). Nvivo is a software that facilitates descriptive coding to
identify and categorise concepts in the 217 news articles (159 following
Four Corners and 58 following the Senate Inquiry). Nvivo allows for
constant comparison between codes, review and redefifinition of con
cepts as new ones are identifified or merged during analysis. The content
analysis identifified key areas to apply discourse analysis to gain further
depth from the data. This type of analysis also allowed for frame eva
luation whereby to â€œframe is to select some aspect of a perceived reality
and make them salientâ€ [35:52]. This included how the Tasmanian
salmon industry was framed in the news media and how difffferent actors
framed the industry and related discourse following the two events.
Dryzek [36] defifines discourse as a â€œshared way of apprehending the
world â€¦constructing meanings and relationship and helping defifine
common sense and legitimate knowledgeâ€. Wodak [37] also fore
grounds the importance of contextualizing the discourse by taking note
of â€œintertextual and interdiscursive relationshipsâ€, â€œsocial variables and
institutional frames of a specifific context of situationâ€, and â€œthe broader
socio-political and historical context, which discursive practices are
embedded in and related toâ€. In order to â€œuncover the way reality is
producedâ€, the content analysis drives the discourse analysis in that it
identififies areas for further investigation [38:19]. Riffffe, Lacy [39] ex
plains that â€œcontent analysis serves to elicit the frequency of certain
features and makes variation in the communication content explicit as
well as measurableâ€. The nature of content analysis assures that all
units of data receive equal treatment [40].
To identify if and how the Four Corners and the Senate Inquiry in-
flfluence how difffferent actors are presented in the media and the ap
parent flflow of information between key interest groups, the analysis
identifified;
1) The actors or groups present in the news articles and the number of
articles they were either mentioned or quoted in; and
2) The relationship between these groups. This was identifified by the
type of claims made (positive or negative), who made these claims
and who were the targets of these claims. This was determined by
the language used in news coverage.
3. Results
The number of news articles identifified in this study was 268%
greater following the Four Corners program compared to that of the
Senate Inquiry (Fig. 2). This increase was most obvious in The Hobart
Mercury.
Both the Senate Inquiry and the Four Corners program led to a
proliferation of difffferent framing of the salmon industry. Salmon
farming's environmental performance was the most common type of
content in news media concerning the industry following both in
vestigations.
3.1. Senate Inquiry into the regulation of the fifin-fifish aquaculture industry in
Tasmania
The Senate Inquiry played a notable role in raising concerns of
environmental impacts in the news media. For example, following the
Senate Inquiry the discourse exhibited a focus on the management of
Macquarie Harbour in relation to the low dissolved oxygen and impact
on the benthic habitat. Concerns regarding environmental impact of the
expansion of the salmon industry in Tasmanian were responded to by
companies by promoting awards and certifification received for their
efffforts toward environmental sustainability.
The Senate Inquiry played a notable role in introducing the role of
science â€“ if not scientists themselves â€“ in news media, primarily pre
senting science as a problem solver and an integral component in in
forming corporate and political environmental decision-making.
Following the Senate Inquiry 25% of the news articles and 55% fol
lowing the Four Corners program mentioned science in a general ca
pacity, such as the role of science in informing the management of the
Tasmanian salmon industry or excerpts from scientifific reports.
However, only 7% and 3% of articles respectively featured scientists
themselves. Following the Senate Inquiry, four scientists were present
in news media (two IMAS scientists (one quoted) and environmental
scientists from Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne universities (all
quoted)). Only three Tasmanian scientists â€“ including two marine sci
entists (one quoted) and one political scientist (quoted) â€“ and one en
vironmental scientist from Melbourne (quote was taken from Four
Corners) were present in the news coverage following Four Corners. This
could be considered a very low presence of scientists as actors in media
coverage considering the relatively high attention given to scientifific
reports and the debate over scientifific information and its role in en
vironmental governance (Table 1).
The Senate Inquiry instigated formal public debate concerning the
adequacy of the environmental regulatory process of the industry.
Those opposing salmon farming in Tasmania and factions of the in
dustry raised concerns regarding the independence of the regulatory
process. These claims were grounded in the perception that the gov
ernment regulatory body at the time was both the proponent and reg
ulator of the industry. As one of the Senate Inquiry committee members
reportedly stated that there was a â€œ"community perception" of potential
conflflict of interest in the same bureaucracy being the industry's "reg
ulator and proponent" [41].

311The social network present in the media following the Senate
Inquiry was simple and did not prompt many new actors to be present
in the news media. The Tasmanian Salmon Industry was commonly
referred to as one entity (Fig. 3).
The industry embraced the Senate Inquiry as an opportunity to
â€œshowcaseâ€ the industry, showing confifidence that the industry will
come out of it stronger and â€œwelcome[ed] the Inquiry's focus on
transparency around waterway healthâ€ [42]. While both Liberal and
Labor parties opposed the Senate Inquiry, with Labor leader, Bryan
Green explaining that the industry underwent rigorous monitoring re
gimes and politicizing the issue would diminish public confifidence in the
salmon industry [43]. The resistance from political parties for the in
quiry into the industry may have promoted the lack of trust in reg
ulatory processes instigated by Huon Aquaculture and expressed
through news media, broadcast television and radio, social media and
legal proceedings.
3.2. Four Corners â€“ â€œBig Fishâ€
Concerns of environmental impacts on the farms surrounding en
vironment were further emphasised following Four Corners and the
importance and critique of their mitigation was highlighted. The dis
course regarding the environmental impact on Macquarie Harbour, fifirst
present in the Senate Inquiry, was carried by the Four Corners program
and further reinforced as a news issue by Huon Aquaculture's legal
proceedings.
The environmental discourse concerning Macquarie Harbour pro
vided a strong platform for groups to shape their opposition to the
expansion on the East Coast of Tasmania. Claims from opposition
groups promoted debate concerning the adequacy of the regulatory
process in Tasmania to mitigate environmental impacts of the aqua
culture practice. Industry and Government actors addressed these
concerns by noting the high environmental standards and practices of
the Tasmanian salmon industry, both in the local and global context, by
asserting that regulation rests on the input of independent and quality
science and promoting third party certifification of the industry. Tassal
and Government actors also responded by asserting that opposition
groups and Four Corners journalists were misrepresenting the extent of
environmental impacts of salmon production. It was reported that the
State Government â€œtook aimâ€ at a local environmental group [44] and
"debunk[ed]" claims from "green groups" that the Okehampton Bay site
would not be sustainableâ€ [45].
Compared to the relatively contained social network present in the
news media following the Senate Inquiry, the Four Corners program
expanded the number of actors present in news media and revealed
unexpected coalitions and alliances between stakeholders (Fig. 4). This
created more complexity in the conflflict relative to that of the Senate
Inquiry. Most notably, Four Corners publicly highlighted a shift in in
dustry cohesiveness. The division among industry in Tasmania was
brought to the fore in Four Corners, which explicitly identifified claims of
industry corruption and environmental degradation.
From publicly acting and being perceived publicly as one unit,
variances developed in individual company's communications and how
they are being portrayed and perceived in the public sphere. News
media following Four Corners displays negative perceptions toward
Tassal. Whereas Huon Aquaculture appears to be publicly forming po
sitive relationships with local ENGOs (although it comes at the cost of a
negative relationship with WWF). The public adversity towards Tassal
also experiences input from a greater number of actors following Four
Corners. This was instigated by the Four Corners program itself but also
related to Tassal's expansion on the East Coast instigating the formation
of local opposition groups. The industry division was not only carried
through news media, but also social media sites such as Twitter and
Facebook with posts indicating a preference to purchase Huon products
or an adversity to purchasing from Tassal. An ethical investment fifirm
was also persuaded by ENGOs to halt investment in Tassal.
Along with increased complexity of actor networks and associated
claims-making, news coverage following Four Corners was char
acterised, and complexity reinforced, by conflflict compared with that of
the Senate Inquiry. In news coverage, this was represented through the
following: word choice in stories about Huon Aquaculture's legal action,
portrayed hostility between and among key stakeholder groups; the use

312of words such as attack, divisive, extremist, hot topic, conflflict and squab
bling; accusations of double standards and use of misinformation; and
through claims that key actors were not engaging outside of media.
Reinforcing the presence of conflflict, actors in the media identify the
need for collaborative, rational and respectful discourse.
Editorials began to address and highlight the conflflict present in the
discourse and suggested methods for resolution. In its editorial, â€˜The
power of compromiseâ€™, the Hobart Mercury states that;
The Mercury's position is straightforward. Aquaculture is vital for
the future of the state's economy. Absolutely vital. We want to see it
do well. It creates desperately needed jobs at a time when un
employment and under-employment remain among our greatest
blights. But it needs to be sustainable and we make no apologies for
shining a light on when this may have failed. The debacle that
Macquarie Harbour is fast becoming cannot be allowed to persist.
We must learn from this, be honest in our assessment and put in
place measures that ensure it is resolved and never happens again.
And the industry needs to move beyond meaningless press releases
and background briefifings and genuinely build internal bridges.
Without a unifified front, it will be complicit in its own demise. The
heads of all companies need to sit around a table, put whatever
difffferences they have aside and agree on a path forward. Extreme
sides â€” mired in cheap shots and offffering information that is either
incredibly biased or completely wrong â€” do nothing to advance
either position. Aquaculture represents a genuine opportunity for
Tasmania â€” an opportunity to build something together as a state.
A line in the sand needs to be drawn. Leadership needs to be shown
[46].
Similarly, also in an article in the Hobart Mercury following Four
Corners, the then sustainability manager of Tassal acknowledges that
â€œvigorous debate is healthyâ€ while â€œunproductive conflflictâ€¦is damaging
for everyoneâ€ [47].
The conflflict among the industry was further amplifified by the ap
parent, traditionally unlikely, alliance between Huon Aquaculture and
Environment Tasmania self-described as; â€œthe peak group for environ
ment organisations in the stateâ€¦[a] campaigning organisation best
known for leading the alliance that stopped the Super Trawler Margiris
from fifishing in Australian waters, and for our part in the Tasmanian
Forest Agreementâ€ [48]. It could be construed that by publicly sup
porting Huon Aquaculture for its efffforts to reduce the environmental
impacts of salmon farming, Environment Tasmania was claiming to
have created a partnership to achieve better environmental
performance. However, the same ENGO discredited rather than sup
ported Tassal's efffforts to mitigate environmental impacts and to im
prove the industry standard for transparency and accountability in re
porting environmental reporting through its annual sustainability
reports. Furthermore, Environment Tasmania also carried the discourse
prompted by Four Corners concerning the credibility of the global
conservation ENGO, WWF and its partnership with Tassal into the news
media. This discourse was framed as corruption by Environment Tas
mania circulating a petition calling for WWF to halt the partnership.
The results indicate that the Four Corners program prompted the
presence of Environment Tasmania in the news media. This could re
inforce the symbiotic relationship between NGOs and journalists
[49â€“51]. However, supporting [52] fifindings, the ENGOsâ€™ presence in
the media is still not as prevalent as corporate and political re
presentatives (Table 2).
These results indicate that these critical moments in the discourse
were not solely a result of environmental campaigns, which have his
torically played a signifificant role in environmental discourse in
Tasmania [see 7,53,54]. Rather, in the case of salmon aquaculture,
Environment Tasmania is shown to leverage these critical moments for
its own strategic purposes. This is not to say that these campaigning
organisations have not provided a solid grounding for corporate players
to use the environmental discourse as a legitimate source of concern.
However, it exemplififies a shift in the traditional role of ENGOs in
holding industries and Governments to account, to an industry player
taking this role.
4. Discussion
By revisiting the research questions, the analysis of frames has been
able to establish that the Four Corners program and Senate Inquiry
were able to promote difffferent framing and engagement with the per
ceived issues of the salmon industry. The Senate Inquiry process pro
vided a platform for dialogue regarding the claims being made con
cerning the regulation of the industry's expansion. Comparatively, Four
Corners was a one-way information stream outward which contained
the controlled and subjective information it chose to seek out and in
clude. Public debate, as conveyed in news media, was more contained
in the Senate Inquiry compared with Four Corners. It could be construed
that this was because of the formality of the Senate Inquiry compared to
the controversy presented by the Four Corners program, activating a
discourse of conflflict between and among key stakeholder groups.
It is evident in this case that media events such as Four Corners can

relationships and solid arrows indicate positive relationships. Boxed stakeholders and the size of the box indicate the number of news articles they are mentioned in.

313instigate greater news media attention, involvement and diversity of
actors, emphasis on alliances and conflflicts and debate over governance.
What is interesting however is that the Senate Inquiry and Four Corners
were instigated by conflflict internal to industry. In this case environ
mental campaigns, rather than instigating the two events identifified by
this analysis, are shown to leverage these critical moments for their own
strategic purposes. Additionally, while Four Corners may not be the sole
cause for the conflflict present in the news media discourse, it does ap
pear to be the platform for which opposition groups, political parties,
salmon companies, community members and journalists used to build
and shape their case. It could be construed that Huon Aquaculture's
breaking of industry ranks, fifirst present in the Senate Inquiry and
publicised in Four Corners, acted as the prompt for the shift in public
discourse.
It has been acknowledged that popular â€˜soft journalismâ€™ programs,
such as Four Corners, have the capacity to create frames that are then
diffiffifficult to dislodge in subsequent public debate [55]. The impact this
has on how difffferent information is perceived, for example science, is
highlighted here. In the case of Tasmanian salmon, scientifific informa
tion was used as a political tool by actors within mediatised environ
mental conflflict, yet scientists themselves were not key actors in this
case. This was evident across the two events, however most noticeable
following the Four Corners program. Following the Senate Inquiry,
while some debate concerning the validity of the science-based in
formation was present this was not one of the more prominent features
in the news articles. Comparatively, articles where the validity of the
scientifific information was debated and information was selectively
wielded to support agendas, actions or statements were more frequent
following Four Corners. As a result, uncertainty was created concerning
the independence, relevance, and role of science in informing opposi
tion campaigns, corporate decisions and Government regulations re
garding the environmental impact of the industry.
Given the dominance of the environment-at-risk discourse and the
acknowledgement and use of scientifific information in claims and
counter claims by non-experts, the lack of participation by scientists
themselves in the media response following Four Corners is a discernible
gap. Further exploration of the apparent absence of scientists in the
mediatised environmental debate could reveal nuances regarding the
communications pathways and barriers in evidence-based decision
making where public debate is heightened.
Ambiguity and uncertainty is further emphasised in the media fol
lowing the Senate Inquiry which highlighted a disconnect between 1)
local concerns regarding adequacy of the environmental regulatory
process at a time of industry expansion and 2) the globally recognised
environmental certifification that the salmon companies were being
awarded and promoted. This disconnect was further heightened fol
lowing the Four Corners program with the introduction of a contentious
relationship occurring between local ENGO, Environmental Tasmania,
and salmon company, Huon Aquaculture, and between transnational
ENGO, WWF, and salmon company, Tassal. If Environment Tasmania's
support for Huon Aquaculture is broadly portrayed as legitimate while
WWF's partnership with Tassal is framed as corrupt, this then adds
considerable complexity regarding what constitutes a legitimate part
nership between an ENGO and corporate entity. The impact that the
increased complexity of these relationships and greater number of ac
tors has on the governance of the salmon aquaculture industry in
Tasmania is an important area for further research.
5. Conclusions
This analysis has revealed how news media inflfluenced difffferent
actorsâ€™ responses to, and how news media itself responded to, various
modes of investigation into the environmental impact of the salmon
aquaculture industry. The Four Corners program â€œBig Fishâ€ and Senate
Inquiry into the â€œregulation of the fifin-fifish aquaculture industry in
Tasmaniaâ€ have inflfluenced agendas and issues within public discourse,
emphasised changing roles and responsibilities of key actors as well as
revealing relationships between and among stakeholder groups. Further
research into not only the relationships between claims-makers and
decision-makers but the apparent blurring of what constitutes and de-
fifines these roles could allow for insights into the processes of inflfluence
and framing between media, public and policy in the governance of not
only salmon farming but other sectors.

ABSTRACT
This paper examines public conflict over the rapid growth of the Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture industry and associated environmental and social
impacts. By conducting a media analysis, triangulated with key stakeholder
interviews, we find news media discourse was predominantly framed by
environmental risk, expansion of the industry and the in/effectiveness of
Government regulation. Environmental science and community interests
were conflated within these themes, leading to a perceived lack of transpar
ency and loss of trust in both environmental science information and regula
tion of environmental impacts. Government, salmon companies and science
institutions were the most frequently mentioned stakeholder groups within
news media, suggesting they had power to facilitate virtuous cycles â€“ that is,
shared goals and language. However, these stakeholder groups were por
trayed to be outwardly opaque in their communications of, and lacking
engagement in, decision-making processes. By revealing how science, socie
tal values and decision-making were negotiated in news media through this
conflict, we hope to contribute to the understanding of how vicious and
virtuous cycles can be facilitated by various stakeholders and within media.

1. Introduction
The salmon aquaculture industry is no stranger to public conflict, with a number of scholars exploring
how the industry is represented in media in different growing regions (Amberg and Hall 2010; Olsen and
Osmundsen 2017; Sha et al. 2015; Cullen-Knox et al. 2019). While it represents only a small amount of
global salmon production, Tasmanian salmon aquaculture has a long history of contention, with Leith,
Ogier, and Haward (2014b) identifying what they term a â€˜vicious cycle of distrustâ€™ â€“ that is, â€˜cherry-picking,
secrecy and misinterpretationâ€™ in the use of science information and claim-making (pp. 290). In this cycle,
â€˜reputational capital is traded away by all parties in costly, unproductive, and acrimonious processesâ€™ (pp.
291) destabilising the â€˜social license to operateâ€™ (Cullen-Knox et al. 2017). By contrast, virtuous cycles are
â€˜deliberate, slow and consideredâ€™ and are characterised by shared â€˜goals and languageâ€™ creating trust
between and among stakeholder groups (Leith, Ogier, and Haward 2014b). Leith, Ogier, and Haward
(2014b) find that environmental science can play a pivotal role in how a social license to operate functions
in scenarios of aquaculture where common pool resources are utilised by large companies. While
acknowledging that science is not neutral (Boykoff and Goodman 2009), Leith, Ogier, and Haward
(2014b) suggest that the involvement of third-party scientists in environmental conflict can foster trust,

Â© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Groupinformed debate and distribution of responsibility, potentially turning vicious cycles into virtuous ones.
Such virtuous cycles shift contention around environmental science information toward acknowledge
ment and understanding.
Here we take the opportunity to develop a nuanced understanding of how news media might
help emphasise, explain, exacerbate or resolve these deliberative processes within the context of the
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry conflict. Leith, Ogier, and Haward (2014b) acknowledge the
usefulness of deliberative processes to link science, societal values and decision-making. One of their
industry interview participants noted the importance of finding pathways that mitigate vicious
cycles of conflict when they stated that â€˜we canâ€™t just be meeting in the media . . . there has to be
a process, and we are just starting that processâ€™ (Leith, Ogier, and Haward 2014b, 289). These
â€˜processesâ€™ were interpreted to include narratives around engagement and enacted by research
projects mapping public values of waterways. However, the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry
went on to experience heightened environmental conflict (Cullen-Knox et al. 2019), in which media
played more than a neutral role â€“ that is, the conflicts were mediatised.
In order to assess how environmental risks of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania are framed and
negotiated in the public sphere (Habermas 1991), this paper will identify and analyse the narratives
presented in news media discourse. The public sphere encompasses the â€˜constellation of communicative
spaces in society that permit the circulation of information, ideas, debates â€“ ideally in an unfettered
manner â€“ and also the formation of political will (i.e., public opinion)â€™ (Dahlgren 2005, 148). Media are core
to the enactment of the contemporary public sphere. Therefore, by focusing on how Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture is presented in Tasmanian and Australian news media, this study sheds light on the
relationship between public knowledge and policy formation. We want to understand the role media
play in public negotiations of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture by (a) identifying and analysing dominant
themes and stakeholders within news media coverage, particularly where disputed and ambiguous social
and scientific information appears; and (b) considering how associated media practices and logics might
influence outcomes of complex common pool natural resource-use conflicts.
To begin, this paper provides background to the Tasmanian industry, contextualising growth and
the current status of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania. It then outlines the theory of mediatised
environmental conflict and how it can be applied to explore vicious and virtuous cycles. We then
describe the methods used before examining how risks are publicly framed and negotiated by different
stakeholders and whether these interactions are virtuous or vicious. We consider our findings in
relation to the stakeholders in Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, how and what information they carry
in the public sphere and the role media play in this flow of information between stakeholders.
1.1. Background: Tasmanian Salmon Aquaculture Industry
Cultivated over decades, Tasmania has a rich, antagonistic history of environmental politics.
Generations have experienced entrenched conflict in which the discourses of economic growth
and environmental impact continue to compete. At the time of the study, the Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture industry was undergoing a considerable growth period. In 2009, the industry
announced plans to double its value to a 1 USD billion a year (DPIPWE 2017). To achieve this growth,
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture companies expanded into new farming areas. Of the three compa
nies that farm Atlantic Salmon in Tasmania, Tassal is the largest (100% publicly listed), followed by
Huon Aquaculture (a family-founded company that floated 30% on the Australian Securities
Exchange in 2014), with Petuna the smallest (100% privately owned).
In early 2016, Tassal applied to expand into an existing but unused lease in Okehampton Bay on
the islandâ€™s East Coast, a favourite holiday destination for Tasmanians and an area new to salmon
farming. This application was put to the Marine Farming Review Panel to assess its suitability to farm
salmon. At the same time, Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast was being investigated for
environmental degradation linked to aquaculture. Tassal1 had forfeited Aquaculture Stewardship
Council (ASC) certification for leases in Macquarie Harbour in 2016 and was ordered by the
2
C. CULLEN-KNOX ET AL.Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to destock its lease closest to the World Heritage area by
February 2017.
In October 2016, the Australian Broadcasting Corporationâ€™s (ABC) flagship investigative journalism
television program, Four Corners, aired an episode nationally titled â€˜Big Fishâ€™, â€˜exposingâ€™ the salmon
aquaculture industry (Four Corners 2016). This program was followed by a peak in news media
attention and public scrutiny, with the impact noted by ABC News:
Salmon giant Tassal . . . concedes it had been a tough year for scrutiny since Four Corners aired concerns about
the health of the west-coast Tasmanian harbour. (Burgess 2017)
The disruption and the complexity of the conflict created by the â€˜Big Fishâ€™ program (Cullen-Knox et al.
2019) and the uncertainty constructed by the conflict were exemplified by an opinion column,
published in the Hobart Mercury newspaper:
So what is the truth about the impact of the farmed salmon industry on Tasmanian waters? This is a difficult
question to answer. The claims and counter claims of business, unions, Governments, political parties and
environmental groups are not helping the situation. Each has a bias, understandably so, but it means that one
should be cautious in accepting their claims . . . Can we, as a community, instead have a nuanced, rational
discussion and respectful discourse about the impact of this multi-million dollar industry on Tasmaniaâ€™s marine
environment? (Barns 2017)
In â€˜Big Fishâ€™, Huon Aquaculture was portrayed as environmentally conscious. By February 2017, the
company had broken industry ranks by leaving the stateâ€™s seafood industry organisation and beginning
unprecedented legal action against the EPA and Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry, Parks,
Water and Environment (DPIPWE). Reportedly, the company sued the Government departments for
â€˜fail[ing] to manage and protect the environment in Macquarie Harbourâ€™ (Meldrum-Hanna, 2017).
Tassal, represented in the â€˜Big Fishâ€™ episode as a â€˜corporate juggernautâ€™, joined the proceedings in
support of the Government. This deepened the conflict between salmon aquaculture companies. Both
federal and state Governments have remained committed to the expansion of the industry, despite
being criticised for environmental exploitation of public waterways to support economic growth and
profit for particular companies (Tiller, Brekken, and Bailey 2012; Vince and Haward 2017).
1.2. Approach and Methods
We adopt the view posited by Hutchins and Lester (2015) that environmental conflict is a product of
the often complex interplay between â€˜(i) activist strategies and campaigns, (ii) journalism practices
and news reporting, (iii) formal politics and decision-making processes, and (iv) industry activities
and tradeâ€™ (Hutchins and Lester 2015, 337). Mediatisation captures a large-scale transformation in
everyday life, society, culture and contemporary politics, a process where media has infiltrated into
all domains of society (Krotz 2017), and one to which decisions over salmon aquaculture are not
immune. Likened to the processes of globalisation, society cannot escape mediatisation where the
power and effects of media shape and frame communication as well as the society for which
communication occurs. Such social transformations are referred to as â€˜meta-processesâ€™ (Lundby
2009). Media are no longer able to be neatly separated from society (Deuze 2012). Mediatisation
has become systemic over the last two decades and mediatisation theory and â€˜media-centeredâ€™
research â€˜involves a holistic understanding of the various intersecting social forces at work at the
same time as we allow ourselves to have a particular perspective and emphasis on the role of media
in these processesâ€™ (Hepp, Hjarvard, and Lundby 2015, 316). In this paper, we seek to understand how
mediation of environmental conflict occurs in the context of mediatisation and how vicious and
virtuous cycles are impacted by this. As such, news media texts and key informant interviews were
collected for analysis, and we approached this data seeking insights into how the environmental
risks of salmon aquaculture were perceived, articulated, negotiated and potentially resolved across
media and communication networks and between key stakeholder groups.
SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
3News articles were sourced using the Factiva news database, claiming nearly 33,000 sources of
news globally (Jones 2018), using the search words: â€˜salmon farmâ€™ OR â€˜fish farmâ€™ OR â€˜salmon
aquacultureâ€™ OR Tassal OR â€˜Huon Aquacultureâ€™ OR Petuna. News articles from 1 November 2016
and 1 May 2017 were collected. This was the six-month period following the Four Corners episode
â€˜Big Fishâ€™, which created a spike in news media discussing the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry (see Cullen-Knox et al. 2019). According to the Factiva database search, the news sites
that published the most articles in this six-month period were; Hobart Mercury (98), ABC News (49),
Burnie Advocate (37), Launceston Examiner (28), and The Australian (7) (Table 1). The Hobart Mercury,
Burnie Advocate and Launceston Examiner are daily regional newspapers and represent a range of
viewpoints. ABC News is a public news service, while The Australian is conservative in its reporting.
Other news outlets which emerged from the key word searches were primarily related to financial
information â€“ for example, regular share price updates â€“ and were excluded from the analysis. Also
excluded were stories concerning other fish farming operations around Australia. The dataset
provided by Factiva includes both articles written by journalists/news outlets and opinion pieces
submitted by any interested parties or the general public. Opinion pieces were included in this data
set because they are the outcome of news media practices and decisions â€“ that is, they meet
publishing criteria and are presented to readers as worthy of publication. They are part of the
package of information on salmon aquaculture that is presented to the public. The information
contained in the opinion pieces contributes to mediated reality and public knowledge (Johnson
cartee 2005; Page, Shapiro, and Dempsey 1987), see also Olsen and Osmundsen (2017) and
Osmundsen and Olsen (2017).
To provide depth, context and triangulation to the textual data, in-depth semi-structured inter
views were conducted (Britten 1995). Interviews provide rich personal experience that other data
sources cannot often generate, if requiring interpretation by the researcher (Neuendorf 2004). A total
of 15 interviews were conducted by the first author from mid-2017 to early 2018 with Tasmanian
salmon aquaculture companies (5), ENGOs (3), Government regulatory authorities (2), scientists
involved in Tasmanian salmon aquaculture research (2), journalists who have reported on the
industry in Tasmanian newspapers (2), and those involved in third-party certification of the industry
(1). The interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed as per the studyâ€™s approved
ethics protocol. Transcriptions were provided to the respective interviewees for approval and the
opportunity to make any changes. No participants made any significant changes.
Interviews aimed to obtain information regarding the informantsâ€™ understanding and perceptions
regarding the operating environment of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry, and how
participants gathered information to form their perceptions, communication mechanisms and
strategies. They also sought to map and understand interactions between key stakeholders.
We carried out a two-step analysis of interview and news media texts, using Nvivo 11 software
(QSR International), a software that allows for descriptive hierarchal coding of prevalent concepts
within qualitative data. The first step was a content analysis, which served to highlight areas for
further discourse analysis to â€˜uncover the way reality is producedâ€™ (Hardy, Harley, and Phillips 2004,
19). Content analysis identifies the frequency of content making discourse themes that are present in
the text clear and quantifiable (Riffe, Lacy, and Fico 2014). For this research, we coded for the
presence of stakeholder groups and discourse themes within articles. We noted all mentions, not
only those in which stakeholders were directly quoted.
Our second step involved a deeper discourse analysis, for which we refer to Hajer and Versteeg
(2005, 175) whereby discourse is â€˜an ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which
meaning is given to social and physical phenomena, and which is produced and reproduced through
an identifiable set of practicesâ€™. Environmental politics and concepts such as sustainable develop
ment â€˜are continuously contested in a struggle about their meaning, interpretation and implemen
tationâ€™ (pp. 176). By unpacking the â€˜key language, rules, norms and values and assumptionsâ€™ we can
focus on the sources of the problem rather than the symptoms (Fleming et al. 2018, 24). Here

2. Results
Analysis of the news articles in the six months following the Four Corners â€˜Big Fishâ€™ episode identified
key stakeholder groups (Table 2 and Figure 1): salmon aquaculture companies (Tassal 61%, Huon
Aquaculture 42%, and Petuna 17%), Government and political actors (60%), scientists/science
institutions (23%), Tasmanian-based ENGOs (18%), emergent local opposition groups (11%) consist
ing of Letâ€™s Grow Tasmaniaâ€™s Future and Marine Protection Tasmania, and community members (7%).
It revealed seven key themes (Table 2 and Figure 2). These are; environment (61%), expansion and
growth (54%), Government regulation (44%), community interests (41%), environmental science
(40%), economic prosperity (35%), sustainability (29%), transparency (26%), and legal action (24%).
The interviews provided further understanding of these themes, providing insight on, for example,
the communication of science, perceptions of transparency between stakeholders and outwardly to
interested members of the public, and how media roles are perceived in public debate (Table 3).
2.1. Environmental Impact
The protection, management and importance of the environment dominated news media in this
analysis (Table 2). This included concerns of current environmental impact, particularly in Macquarie
Harbour, potential environmental impact of proposed expansion or not rectifying impacts of pre
vious expansion, and the importance of considering environmental risk in decision-making pro
cesses. Environmental risk was strongly associated with Government regulation, environmental
science, expansion, and economic interests. Environmental concerns included impact on the benthic
environment, dissolved oxygen depletion, farmed fish health and mortality rates, surrounding
marine life and animal welfare and surrounding world heritage areas. These impacts were observed
in Macquarie Harbour resulting in Tassal forfeiting ASC certification for one of its leases closest to
a world heritage site, the EPA reducing stocking limits and Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal action claiming
inadequate regulation of the harbour.
2.2. Adequacy of the Regulation of Industry Expansion
The perceived regulatory and environmental failings of the management of salmon farming in
Macquarie Harbour gave grounds for parts of the Tasmanian community to question whether
Government and industry, and the environmental science that informed their decision-making,
could ensure that industry expansion (particularly Tassalâ€™s proposed Okehampton Bay site) would
not pose unacceptable environmental risk:
One of the stateâ€™s three big salmon producers, Huon Aquaculture, told last nightâ€™s Four Corners program it
believed a potential disaster was looming in Macquarie Harbour where the industry had expanded in recent
years . . . The program also highlighted community interests about Tassalâ€™s proposal to farm salmon at
Okehampton Bay on the east coast. (ABC News 2016a)2
This was framed by an interviewee as leading to a loss of trust:
I genuinely feel the planning process is one of the big ones that let us down. Not helped by the fact that
Macquarie Harbor did go pear shaped and people have lost trust. So, the idea of saying to people, â€œWeâ€™ve got
a planning process,â€ is not very reassuring to anyone these days. (Interviewee 11)
Huon Aquaculture was reported to argue that regulatory measures were lagging:
â€œWe are saying to the Government: â€˜Weâ€™ve set the bar, you catch upâ€™,â€ said Huon co-founder Frances Bender. â€œIt
has to be comparable (to worldâ€™s best practice) because if it isnâ€™t . . . theyâ€™ll be too many of us, too close together,

with â€œsilenceâ€ from the Hodgman Government. (Denholm 2016)
Additionally, while Tassal is seen to promote the quality of Government regulations, the CEO also
promotes an additional â€˜industry funded watchdogâ€™ when he is reported to state: â€˜We know we have

the concerns of independence of the regulatory process:
Primary Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff has denied the 700 USD million industry is not regulated strongly
enough, and told ABC 936 Hobart he was disappointed in the way the industry was portrayed [in the Four
Corners Episode] . . . Mr Rockliff said the Government had strengthened the industryâ€™s regulatory regime. â€œWeâ€™ve
made enormous inroads to ensure there is a far better armâ€™s length process,â€ he said. â€œNow the Environment
Protection Authority is in charge of the entire supply chain when it comes to regulating salmon, weâ€™ve actually
also strengthened the penalties for those that breach the feed cap or the nitrogen cap. (Bevin, Whitson, and
Carlyon 2017)
With fragments of information provided in media regarding these regulatory changes, there is
a notable lack of information regarding how and why these changes were decided.
2.2.1. The Role of Environmental Science in Formal Regulatory Processes
Science institutions were most mentioned (apart from environment and environmental science) in
articles that also mentioned formal regulatory processes. This portrays a strong correlation between
the two in the public sphere. However, no clear information was provided regarding this
relationship:
Government stakeholders used science information to support their claims of â€œgood regulationâ€ and was the
group that most used science to â€œdebunk claimsâ€, in this case claims of â€œgreen groups.â€ (Inglis 2017b)
We [the Government in power] have always said we will be guided by the science and I now call on those
opposed to this proposal to abide by the independent umpireâ€™s decision.â€ (Lohberger and Richards 2017)
Similarly, an interviewee emphasised the link between community interests and science and the
ambiguity regarding how these are considered in the regulatory process:
You can come up with science measures but I think people actually want to see how do we relate that to the
things that they care about, and how do we prioritise that? . . . Where in the planning process is the community?
That is where [scientists] started doing a lot more of trying to relate the science to what people value.
(Interviewee 11)
Concern was also raised by a range of interview participants that the collection of more detailed
environmental data was suggested only in order to appease community concerns rather than deliver
environmental outcomes. One interviewee explained that this use of science could reduce the
capacity for conversations to address the science being conducted and the subsequent results
and recommendations, referred to as the â€˜real scienceâ€™:
I have talked to some of [those opposed to a new salmon farm], â€œWe just donâ€™t want a marine farm there. Visually
we donâ€™t want one there.â€ Well, that is fine, that is a reason for not having one, itâ€™s a valid argument. Government
were doing the same on the other side of the coin, everyone just kept using the science, but really, I do not
think . . . we actually never got to speak about the real science. (Interviewee 3)
While science information and science institutions were frequently mentioned in news media, in
interview scientists appeared to be reluctant to contribute to the deliberations over risk definition in
media â€“ as one interviewee noted, because â€˜these debates . . . tend to be politicalâ€™ (Interviewee 11).
While environmental scientists could explain the implications that different farming regimes were
likely to have on the environment and the risk of these occurring, â€˜acceptability is a political decision,
because that is a social decision about what they are prepared to tolerateâ€™ (Interviewee 11). This
means there are instances where Government decision-making does not align with science recom
mendations due to political reasons (Interviewee 2).
2.2.2. Transparency of Science Information, Formal Decision Processes and The Role of Media

and news articles. The ownership and transparency of environmental science, and how this

aquaculture companies, environmental groups and political parties. In a news article Huon
Aquaculture renders the public release of scientific findings as a key accountability mechanism for
Government decision-making, while also emphasising the ownership of scientific information and
power relations:
The companyâ€™s [Huon Aquaculture] executive director Frances Bender said she was â€œpleadingâ€ with EPA director
Wes Ford to release IMASâ€™ findings to the public. â€œI donâ€™t see how you can interpret no oxygen at the bottom of
the harbour and the fauna in the sediments being deceased, as being anything [else],â€ Mrs Bender said. (Inglis
2017c)
Notable is the absence of a rebuttal or information regarding Government processes regarding
public release of scientific information. How to legitimately communicate science information is
highlighted when an interviewee stated:
There has been no independent authoritative voices to talk to the science publicly since this issue began. We
have not seen . . . scientists . . . talking publicly about their findings. [Salmon aquaculture companies] cannot talk
about it because then people say, â€œItâ€™s your science.â€ If Government had to talk about it, and they largely do not,
and do not know how to explain it, then there is a perce[ption] of Government and industry colluding to either
not release the science, or to influence the appearance of science, or assuming that itâ€™s not good science. Itâ€™s just
a really easy way to knock out reality from a campaigning perspective. (Interviewee 14)
During interviews, opposition groups expressed concern that companies and the Government were
not disclosing information in a timely or useful format that allowed for other interested stakeholders
to make informed judgements (Interviewee 10). One interviewee explained the difference between
information provision and trust in that information, depicting the difficulty of communicating
scientific information:
This is where the media fits in quite a lot . . . Everybody says, â€œWe want transparency, we want to see the data,â€
and I have tried in many of the environmental groups to see, â€œDo you really want to see the data? Is that what
you are saying? . . . or do you want to feel that you can trust the output information that you are getting?â€
I think itâ€™s the latter. So, a lot of stuff around transparency and easy access. I think the Government has taken
that on board and said, â€œOkay, we are going to put everything on our websites.â€ What they have not done is
really improve the mechanism in which you find it. So, itâ€™s all there now, everything, you know? In most cases
information goes up very quickly and the reports still go up, but they are still 400-page reports. (Interviewee
11)
Salmon aquaculture companies and Government primarily used websites to make large amounts of
information public. While this information was available, it also needed to be promoted in order to
inform public debate. As one interviewee explained:
[Environmental monitoring programs are] just not promoted. The amount of water quality monitoring they did
for years before and after [the instalment of the Okehampton Bay farm]. But I do not know whether they did not
promote it properly or the public did not want to listen to it. So there is a lot being done that I do not think the
public realise. (Interviewee 3)
While a perceived increase in transparency over the past decade is thought to have made claims
making more accurate and accountable (Interviewee 1), interviewees also suggested that very few
people were accessing or trusting this information. An editorial in the Hobart Mercury acknowl
edged the importance the salmon aquaculture industry played in the Tasmanian economy and
called for greater leadership and unity in their communications and learnings from previous
environmental failings. This begins with meaningful public engagement â€˜beyond meaningless
press releasesâ€™:
The Mercuryâ€™s position is straightforward. Aquaculture is vital for the future of the stateâ€™s economy. Absolutely
vital. We want to see it do well. It creates desperately needed jobs at a time when unemployment and under
employment remain among our greatest blights. But it needs to be sustainable and we make no apologies for
shining a light on when this may have failed. The debacle that Macquarie Harbour is fast becoming cannot be
allowed to persist. We must learn from this, be honest in our assessment and put in place measures that ensure it
10
C. CULLEN-KNOX ET AL.is resolved and never happens again. And the industry needs to move beyond meaningless press releases and
background briefings and genuinely build internal bridges. Without a unified front, it will be complicit in its own
demise. The heads of all companies need to sit around a table, put whatever differences they have aside and
agree on a path forward. Extreme sides â€” mired in cheap shots and offering information that is either incredibly
biased or completely wrong â€” do nothing to advance either position. Aquaculture represents a genuine
opportunity for Tasmania â€” an opportunity to build something together as a state. A line in the sand needs
to be drawn. Leadership needs to be shown. (Hobart Mercury 2017)
While transparency of scientific information was a prominent communications theme in the conflict
discourse, there remained considerable uncertainty among interviewees regarding transparency of
science information and whose role it is to communicate science information:
I certainly think that the science, the actual science could be represented better and more clearly . . . now, is that
up to the companies? Is it up to Government? How do you do that? [the company] want to farm there, itâ€™s not
[the scientists] job to provide science that supports what they are doing. (Interviewee 3)
2.3. Community Interests
Community interests were given similar visibility as environmental science in the news media.
Community interests in articles took the form of community meetings regarding industry operations,
economic benefits for regional communities and the connection between adequate and transparent
scientific information and increased community confidence in decision-making. Community interests
regarding Tassalâ€™s proposed expansion in Okehampton Bay were also frequent in the sample. The
importance of community support was commonly noted, highlighting that community interests were
an important consideration for the industry and its management. Opposition to the Okehampton Bay
proposal focused on potential environmental impact and impact on the aesthetics of the region.
Community members were most mentioned in articles where expansion of the industry was dis
cussed. An opinion piece in The Examiner highlighted community interest in the environmental regula
tion of industry expansion and the concern that regulation would not remain stringent in its absence:
In recognition of growing community interest in the regulation of the salmon industry, we believe the
Okehampton lease should be subject to the most stringent environmental regulations and oversight,â€ Ms
White [opposition party leader] told the media. Surely thatâ€™s already the job of the stateâ€™s Environmental
Protection Agency? At least one would hope so. (Anonymous Opinion 2017)
Community confidence was linked to stringent environmental monitoring and transparency of these
measures. The Government was prevalent in their support for the expansion of the industry
promoting the industry in media for its â€˜world classâ€™ environmental regulations and the significance
to the stateâ€™s economic prosperity:
Premier Will Hodgman said Tasmanians could be proud of the stateâ€™s world-class salmon industry. â€œThe
Government has recently updated environmental regulations for salmon farming to make sure the community
can continue to have confidence in the industry,â€ Mr Hodgman said. â€œWe have also made changes to the Marine
Farming Planning Act will help to ensure environmental regulations keep pace with industry expansion.â€ The
Tasmanian salmon industry is worth 500 USD million, with the State Government aiming to expand it to 1
USD billion by 2030. (Howard 2016)
2.4. Conflation of Environmental Science and Community Interest
Environmental science and community interests were intrinsically conflated within the prominent
themes of environmental risk of industry expansion and the adequacy of Government regulation.
The nexus of community interests, science and Government was exemplified in an editorial in the
Hobart Mercury when building â€˜public confidenceâ€™ was said to rely on the interaction between
science and Government process:
SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
11The decision [to deem Oakhampton Bay suitable for farming] has sparked predictable reactions. Primary
Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff said it â€œdebunks false claims made by green groups around the suitability
of the siteâ€. The Greens and Environment Tasmania have derided the decision as a foregone conclusion. But at
some point the community needs to be able to trust the science at hand and there is no reason we can find at
this point to doubt the findings of the review panel. However, this is very much a test case for the future of the
industry. Not only for how it operates but for how it can cultivate public confidence well into the future. Given
the amount of fog that has clouded the issue in recent times, it is not a test the key players, the Government, nor
the science, can afford to fail. (Hobart Mercury 2017)
2.5. Ambiguous Use of the Term Sustainability
The concept of sustainability in the news media was often used ambiguously in sweeping state
ments with no clear reference to the environmental, economic or social elements of sustainability.
This was exemplified when it was reported in the Mercury that the legal action Huon Aquaculture
was taking against the Government regulator â€˜was about protecting jobs by ensuring the harbour
was sustainably farmedâ€™ (Humphries 2017). Here the reader would need to make the assumption that
Ms Bender was referring to the environmental sustainability of farming. When sustainability was
explicitly defined, it was often the environmental sustainability that was specified. This also depicts
a narrative in the news media that environmental sustainability underpinned and provided the
foundation for sustainable growth and provision of jobs. Government and industry stakeholders
were seen to promote the narrative of sustainable growth and at times acknowledged that this
should align with social licence and community concerns.
2.6. Economic Prosperity
While environmental impact and risk was the prominent concern regarding the industryâ€™s expansion,
the most prominent claim to support the expansion of the industry was the economic prosperity it
provided to the state of Tasmania. Local Government representatives discredited campaigns oppos
ing industry expansion by stating they did not represent factions of local communities that in fact
welcomed employment opportunities. This revealed the jobs verse environment narrative that was
dominant in the expansion discourse:
A rally of 150 salmon industry workers and family members gathered on Parliament House lawns on Wednesday
to hear those employed in aquaculture speak of its importance to regional communities. The rally was in
reaction to a campaign, Letâ€™s Grow Tasmaniaâ€™s Future, against Tassalâ€™s proposal to farm 800,000 salmon at
Okehampton Bay. (Maloney 2017)
With 5200 jobs in the industry, fish cannot be allowed to replace forestry as the environmental battleground in
this state. (Anonymous Opinion 2016)
The Tasmanian Government has given Australiaâ€™s largest salmon producer, Tassal, permission to build a new
farm at Okehampton Bay on Tasmaniaâ€™s east coast. The decision is dividing opinion in the local community, with
some people welcoming the jobs that will be created; while others are worried about the impact that salmon
farming will have on the environment. (Ogilvie 2017)
This struggle between the economic prosperity and environmental preservation agendas was
embodied by what appears to be a space for negotiation at the interface between environmental
science, Government and salmon aquaculture companies:
Tassalâ€™s proposed salmon farm on the East Coast may have been approved, but the fiery conversation it has
provoked shows no sign of dying down . . . While the [Marine Farm Planning Review] Panel deemed the
Okehampton Bay site suitable for salmon farming, it also suggested further environmental surveys of the site
be undertaken. Primary Industries Minister Jeremy Rockliff, who commissioned the report, said the panelâ€™s
findings were a boon for Tasmanian jobs and industry. â€œ[The Government] values the science,â€ he said. â€œWe want
this industry to grow, and grow sustainably.â€ Mr Rockliff also noted that further data on the site would â€œgive the
community confidenceâ€ as the industry moves forward. (Inglis 2017a)
12
C. CULLEN-KNOX ET AL.A council on Tasmaniaâ€™s east coast has approved an application for seafood giant Tassal to expand salmon
production into the area, amid calls it should have waited for an inquiryâ€™s findings on the environmental
impact . . . Mayor Michael Kent last night said the proposal â€” which includes a 200-metre-long jetty â€” would
create much-needed jobs for locals in nearby Triabunna. â€œWe must take the opportunities . . . particularly where
jobs can come into itâ€ Cr Kent said. (ABC News 2016c)
Support for economic growth as the overriding concern was not unequivocal. This was reflected in
the statement of the Mayor of Glamorgan Spring Bay Council who, while generally supportive of
Tassalâ€™s expansion into Okehampton Bay, was reported as stating; â€˜I donâ€™t necessarily mean jobs at all
costs, but we need to evaluate how many jobs are involved, we think 25â€™ (ABC News 2016b). Here,
the economic argument tries to find its place within the â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ discourse and was seen to
quantify the clash between economic and environmental agendas identifying the level of environ
mental risk that was acceptable for the level of economic prosperity.
3. Discussion
At the time of this study, public conflict persisted about the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
industry, exposing entrenched vicious cycles that have prevailed since Leith et al.â€™s work in
2014. We can reflect on this earlier work by Leith, Ogier, and Haward (2014b) and examine how
this contention is presented in media and scholarship by a) identifying and analysing dominant
themes and stakeholders within news media coverage, particularly where disputed and ambig
uous social and scientific information appears; and b) considering how associated media practices
and logics might influence outcomes of complex common pool natural resource-use conflicts. It
offers the opportunity to examine how the prevalent risk themes following national media scrutiny
of the industry might be contributing to vicious cycles in the public sphere. We can also contribute
to understanding how vicious and virtuous cycles are performed by various participants in the
debate. This can help inform pathways for virtuous cycles by better understanding how science,
societal values and decision-making (Leith, Ogier, and Haward 2014b) are negotiated in news
media.
3.1. What are the Prominent Themes in Media Discourse of Tasmanian Salmon
Aquaculture?
Concerns of environmental impact, the adequacy of Government regulation and lack of transparency
evident in Leith et al.â€™s (2014b) work were still prevalent at the time of this study. Experiences of
environmental impact of industry expansion in Macquarie Harbour provided grounding for contin
ued public concerns regarding expansion proposals, primarily those from Tassal. The perceived lack
of engagement by Government and industry decision-makers and transparency of decision-making
processes have reinforced the distrust in the environmental management of the industryâ€™s expan
sion. This includes the knowledge production institutions and processes that inform this decision
making. Drew and Nyerges (2004) conceptualises this as â€˜decision transparencyâ€™ whereby the steps
taken to reach a decision and rationale behind the decision are accessible, accurate, clear and
presented in relation to the broader problem context. The process stipulates stakeholder involve
ment and accountability. Other points for which Government can adopt transparency include: policy
content â€“ what measures are adopted and how they solve a problem â€“ and policy outcomes â€“ what
effect has the policy had (Heald 2006).
Adequate transparency of process and outcomes provides the foundations for accountability, key
pillars of democratic values (Bovens 2007; Grimmelikhuijsen and Welch 2012; Hood 2006; Kjaer
2004). Grimmelikhuijsen and Welch (2012, 563) defines transparency as â€˜the disclosure of information
by an organisation that enables external actors to monitor and assess its internal workings and
performanceâ€™ which â€˜typically incorporates multiple components, including inward observability,
active disclosure, and external assessabilityâ€™.
SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
13Community concerns regarding environmental science were primarily characterised by a perceived
lack of transparency regarding environmental science information and lack of trust in the regulation of
industry expansion. The combination of the environmental risk discourse with that of poor management
was further fuelled by Huon Aquacultureâ€™s legal actions against the Government claiming inadequate
environmental regulation. Irrespective of whether or not the Government decision-making processes
were adequately managing the environment with the information they had or considering a range of
information (such as environmental impact data, interests of other users of the waters and economic
benefits to regional communities), the Government was portrayed to be outwardly opaque in their
communications of these processes. Further contributing to the vagueness regarding how environmen
tal, social and economic factors were considered in the management of salmon aquaculture, the term
â€˜sustainableâ€™ was often ambiguously applied in the news media. While environmental sustainability was
often implied and seen as essential for achieving growth, there was little context provided for how this
was being achieved. The perceived ambiguity regarding governance and management processes has
been a legacy of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture, with Government processes seen as lacking legitimacy
and transparency in Leith et al.â€™s (2014b) work. Particularly regarding inadequate distribution of informa
tion and exclusion of community concerns by Government and industry in these processes. This speaks
to the importance of two-way accessibility component of transparency whereby â€˜stakeholders have
access to Government processes and the Government has access to stakeholder valuesâ€™ (Drew and
Nyerges 2004, 43).
Perceived issues of governance and failure of regulatory mechanisms, along with the dominant
environmental risk framing evident in this research is also prominent in media coverage of salmon
aquaculture around the world (Schlag 2011; Olsen and Osmundsen 2017). The consistency of this
finding across salmon aquaculture regions indicates that there is an identified need and opportunity
for stakeholders involved in the governance and management of fin-fish aquaculture to develop
proactive, transparent and engaging communication of governance processes. The requirement for
greater transparency of state Government decision-making, particularly concerning clear, accessible,
timely and regular information regarding environmental management, also has a long history in
other aquaculture sectors in Australia (Mazur and Curtis 2008). This might include; (1) how different
information (e.g., environmental data and community interests) is collected and processed in
governance mechanisms and (2) how these mechanisms address frequently mentioned issues in
media (e.g., environmental risk, economic growth and regulation).
3.2. Who are the Key Stakeholders in Media Discourse of Tasmanian Salmon Aquaculture?
Government, salmon aquaculture companies and science institutions were the most mentioned
stakeholder groups respectively in the news media. This suggests that these stakeholders could hold
the most leverage to influence the public discourse and therefore facilitate virtuous cycles. The idea
that industry and Government stakeholders hold the most potential to influence media coverage
and therefore play â€˜important roles in strengthening communications and improving the transpar
ency of information especially surrounding public issues of concernâ€™ is evident in similar work
(Weitzman and Bailey 2019, 180). However, our research suggests that, in the case of environmental
risk conflicts, it is worthwhile determining the nuances of science communication in the public
sphere where the discourse over what is acceptable risk is carried out. Particularly in the context of
transparency regarding contentious issues of how industry uses publicly owned common pool
natural resources, such as marine aquaculture.
3.2.1. Communication of Environmental Science Information in Mediatised Environmental Risk
Discourse
This research supports Leith, Ogier, and Haward (2014b)â€™s conclusions that science communication
plays a key role in supporting a virtuous cycle, by having stakeholders with perceived impartial
expertise inject information about prominent topics in the public discourse, taking into account the
14
C. CULLEN-KNOX ET AL.structure of the problem (see Leith et al. 2014a). While Leith et al.â€™s (2014b) research focuses on how
science can better inform decision-making, the findings presented in this paper emphasise the need
for enhancing the outward communication of this process. In particular, the communication of how
acceptable environmental risk and impact is determined in Government decision-making processes
and how and when science informs this process. Acceptability addresses the competing narratives of
growth versus environment. Here it is pertinent to note that while scientists can take accountability
for their results, it is Government which must take responsibility for the overall decisions. In complex
socio-ecological problems clearly understanding and communicating the boundaries and capabil
ities of science and the capacity to deal with scientific uncertainty is just as important as the
requirements for specific technical advice. This provides clear expectations of what science can
and cannot provide in solving socio-ecological problems (Bocking 2013).
The task of communicating complex scientific knowledge to interested publics becomes increas
ingly challenging and complex in politically charged and highly contentious issues involving
a variety of interests, values, attitudes and beliefs. Efforts to test and determine how best to
communicate complex information in lay terms is a contemporary research agenda (Kelly, In press,
Vandyke and Lee 2020). However, in practice, how environmental science information can and
should be communicated to create virtuous cycles within mediatised environmental conflict remains
largely unresolved and unaddressed. While there has been decades of literature that explores the
politicisation of science and scientists (e.g., Nelkin 1975; Jasanoff 1987; Sarewitz 2004), Lewenstein
(2017, 78) proposes â€˜that we have not studied scientific and technical controversies enough to find
the enduring patterns. Perhaps we are just at the beginning of study of controversy, and there is
much to doâ€™. Certainly it has been apparent in this present paper that considerable uncertainty still
exists regarding whose role and responsibility it is to publicly communicate environmental risks
identified by science in the expansion of Tasmanian Salmon farming. In particular, when in the
decision-making process should science information be outwardly disseminated and in what format?
If it is understood that scientific information is unlikely to override competing interests or prevail
in disputes over values (Nelkin 1975), then communication of science information should be
accompanied by a clear definition of what has been determined as an acceptable level of risk in
the decision-making process and how this has been determined. However, â€˜riskâ€™ is not a single fact
nor is there one institution in charge of defining â€˜itâ€™ and communicating â€˜itâ€™ to a separate public.
Rather, risk is an understanding that is continually redefined discursively in different contexts.
Likewise, science is not independent from politics, even the problems that science seeks to under
stand are only considered problems in the context of socially embedded norms, values and interests
(Sarewitz 2004). Moreover, if the acceptable level of environmental risk is socially constructed and
Government decision-making considers a range of information outside of environmental science,
then the social scientists and economists could also play a role in environmental debates in media.
Scientists can be hesitant to participate in controversial debates because of the inherent risk of
getting involved in political issues (Dunwoody, 2015). Some scientists see themselves as separate from
the public sphere altogetherâ€“ â€˜a messy space of negotiation and contest that has a clearly troubled
relationship with factâ€™ (Lester 2019). In some socio-environmental problems, such as climate change
(Sarewitz 2004), we can see that the authority of science can be publicly challenged, potentially
making it even less appealing for scientists to engage publicly in controversial debate. For those actors
entering mediated environmental conflict, they do so with no confidence about how they will be
perceived. However, it is argued that not actively contributing to media debate is â€˜a riskier strategyâ€™
(Lester and Foxwell-Norton, 2020, 114). Lester and Foxwell-Norton explain that:
whether scientists themselves are present or not, their data will be used by the key actorsâ€”media, industry,
Government, and campaignersâ€”and will become a source of contention in itself. When the data is not
accompanied into the public domain by its scientific creators and proponents, it is prone to politicisationâ€”
rendering futile any decision on the part of scientists to deliberately stay out of public debate so as not to
politicise their work. (Lester and Foxwell-Norton 2020, 114)
SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
15Here the â€˜tumultuousâ€™ relationship between science and media (Besley and Tanner 2011, 241) and
science and decision-making (Sarewitz 2004) is evident.
The framing of science in environmental controversies in media is determined by a range of
external factors such as competing newsworthy events, economic and political conditions and the
perceptions of credibility. It is not only how media frame scientific information but also practices of
science such as research problem framing and communicating scientific uncertainty (Bocking 2012).
Arguably greater transparancy of how science information is considered in the decision-making
process along with other interests and knowledges could potentially contribute to reducing the
degree to which science is politicised. Our analysis suggests it is this nexus between environmental
science, social and political definitions of acceptable environmental risk and Government decision
making that, if given greater transparency, could contribute to virtuous cycles within socioecological
debates. However, transparency is unlikely to be the only remedy for entrenched socioecological
conflicts and so this should be placed within a critical assessment of the role of media, politics and
power which should be given active consideration in how discourses work to shape reality and
different agendas.
3.3. What Role Do Media Play in Public Negotiations of Tasmanian Salmon Aquaculture?
Discourse in the news media portrayed that without media scrutiny of the environmental science and
management, the environmental impact, experienced in Macquarie Harbour, would continue. This
was portrayed by Huon Aquaculture, political opposition parties, journalists and community members.
The narrative of uncertainty and distrust was heightened when Huon Aquaculture broke industry
ranks by taking legal action against the Government and coming out in media as condemning the
environmental impact of the industry. This publicly highlighted the variation in definitions of appro
priate level of environmental risk among and between industry, Government regulations and third
party certification providers. Environmental science was used in media discourse to support stake
holdersâ€™ chosen level of acceptable environmental risk. While there is frequent reference to science
information or institutions, this use of science to support competing claims and agendas could explain
why scientists themselves are notably absent from the news media (Cullen-Knox et al. 2019).
The prominence of vicious cycles in the environmental conflicts of Tasmanian salmon aquaculture
in media could be considered inherent with the type of public deliberation and political nature of the
case study chosen. While the vicious/virtuous cycle framework is useful to examine interaction
between stakeholders in public deliberations regarding environmental futures it also raises ques
tions regarding its binary function; is there always a presence of a vicious and virtuous cycle? Or can
there be cases where only vicious or virtuous examples exist? In which case the binary is only useful
as a first step to the data analysis, at which point examining mediatised environmental conflict allows
for further investigation into why vicious cycles are prevalent and identify opportunities to turn
vicious cycles into virtuous ones.
4. Conclusions
Analysing the conflict concerning the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry in news media
exposes entrenched vicious cycles that have prevailed since Leith et al.â€™s work in 2014b and how
they are portrayed to the public. This can inform processes of risk framing and potential opportu
nities for conflict resolution between state and non-state stakeholders. This research suggests that
what is considered acceptable environmental risk of expansion has been determined without
adequate transparency of processes. The outward communication of Government process is just
as important as the processes themselves.
If we consider that how environmental conflict unfolds is determined by the power dynamics
between activists, journalists, industry and politics (Hutchins and Lester 2015), the findings in this
paper suggest that modern media is playing a different role now in the mediation of scientific
16
C. CULLEN-KNOX ET AL.information in public sector decision-making. How science information is communicated within
environmental risk discourses of seafood industry expansion should consider the potential for, and
risks of, scientists becoming political actors. The politicisation of science could be reduced if
scientists themselves carry the information in the public sphere. The Tasmanian case study has
also raised important questions regarding the role that media play (both claimed and actual) as
a catalyst for change in how environmental risks are negotiated within the context of environmental
regulation. Are concerned citizens engaging differently now with these issues as community inter
ests are being conflated with science information? How can complex environmental science infor
mation be most effectively communicated in contentious mediatised debates? Can the concept of
sustainability be applied more usefully in such debates?
These results point to the need for further work to better understand how stakeholders use
science information in media. What does this imply for how â€˜evidenceâ€™ is portrayed in risk commu
nication, interpretation and decision-making? Different discourses work to shape reality in different
ways for different agendas. The role of media and politics should be actively considered in these
types of debates. Having a critical view of media, politics and power is imperative for these
contributions to improve policy process and public information. For example, what mechanisms
are available for stakeholders and concerned citizens to communicate risk definitions in Government
decision-making processes regarding industry expansion (i.e., see Van Putten et al. 2018)? And, are
these mechanisms perceived to be adequate and by whom? If they are in fact considered adequate
then it could confirm that enhancing (clear, regular and proactive) public communication of
decision-making processes could facilitate virtuous cycles. If not, then it could indicate areas of
improvement for how environmental, social and economic information are considered in the
management of the Tasmanian salmon aquaculture industry.

The seafood market is highly globalised with a growing demand for seafood and
fifish products worldwide. The capacity of wild fifisheries is limited and therefore
aquaculture is fast becoming the most stable source of seafood to meet increasing
demand. Subsequently, the perceived environmental risk of fifin-fifish aquaculture has
been the focus of substantial environmental campaigning, media and public scrutiny
around the world. This paper places localised tensions regarding the environmental
impacts of salmon aquaculture within transnational environmental sustainability debates
concerning seafood production and vice-versa, with a focus on the Australia-Asia
region. The results contribute to understanding the interpretation and communication
of environmental sustainability of seafood through international supply chains and
to audiences at different spatial scales. The paper draws particularly on the case
of salmon aquaculture in Tasmania, Australiaâ€™s southern island state. It highlights
mechanisms, such as certifification, for which information flflows transnationally regarding
the environmental sustainability of seafood production, the resultant transnational and
local public sphere and the implications for local discourse, market access, governance
and certifification of seafood production.

INTRODUCTION
Seafood products are some of the most highly traded food commodities globally (FAO, 2016).
Demand for seafood, driven by a growing population, particularly the Asian middle class, requires
the increased use of natural resources globally (Cao et al., 2017). Accompanying this increased
pressure on natural resources to sustain the human population is the rise in awareness of
sustainable development. Sustainable development encompasses the concept that human life is
sustained within the limits of earthâ€™s carrying capacity so that future generations are unimpacted
(IUCN, 1980). The environmental sustainability construct is both widely used and widely disputed
(Seghezzo, 2009). Environmental sustainability can be approached from either the perspective of
how best to protect environmental attributes or how to most optimally use an environmental
resource. Also variously interpreted is how these perspectives fifit in with the construct of
sustainable development.
Given the transnational reality of seafood markets and communication mechanisms, who gets to
defifine environmentally sustainable seafood production and the mechanisms by which they defifine
it is expected to shift with scale. Global risk discourse regarding the environmental sustainability of

Tracing Environmental Sustainability Discourses
seafood production and harvest are increasingly encompassing
the notions of the â€œlocally affffectedâ€ and â€œdistant awareâ€ (Lester,
2014). For local communities, environmental impact, or the risk
of impact, is a lived experience. However, distant consumers,
or those simply with an interest, can be alerted to potential
environmental risks in another location via mechanisms such as
media, campaigning or food labeling. These distant communities
of interest can still participate in the issue through strategies such
as social media or changing their purchasing practices. Within
the context of the â€œtransnational public sphereâ€ (Fraser, 2007:
15), how perceptions of local and global environmental risks of
seafood flflow transnationally is becoming increasingly relevant.
This paper builds on scholarship by Lester (2016) who
investigates the production and flflow of environmental
messages in a transnational context. Lesterâ€™s investigation
reveals environmental campaign organizations engaging
transnationally in an attempt to protect the Great Barrier
Reef from anthropological impact. The sensationalist media
campaigns target international corporations investing in
Australia, distant consumers, and international environmental
governance organizations highlighting the environmental
risks and lack of â€œsocial licenceâ€ (see also Cullen-Knox et al.,
2017). These campaigns also allocate responsibility to â€œglobal
citizensâ€ (Lester, 2016) to remind global organizations and
the Australian government of their accountability to protect
important environments.
Both public and private governance structures inflfluence how
sustainable seafood is defifined at any given time and space. In
his examination of the interpretation of sustainability standards
in international fifisheries policy, Rice (2014) observes how
the malleable nature is accentuated over time. To defifine and
standardize global benchmarks for environmentally sustainable
seafood production, market-based mechanisms such as third
party certifification schemes have been developed. A third-party
certifification label is one of the few ways for customers to
determine what is considered to be sustainable seafood. However,
despite efffforts to standardize the defifinition for sustainable
seafood, â€œsustainabilityâ€ has been so overused as a marketing tool
that some argue it has become meaningless and lost its value and
impact (McEwan and Bek, 2009). There are also concerns that
external sustainability assessments could undermine government
authority (Crona et al., 2016).
International trade can also emphasize the disconnect between
impact on local environments and demands from distant
markets (Steneck et al., 2011). What is considered important
changes across local and global environments, debates, and
markets. For example, seafood traders in China view green
labeling and concerns of environmental sustainability as less
important compared to other factors such as food safety (Fabinyi
et al., 2017). The risk of continued environmental impact can
be considerable if this disconnect is not addressed through
effffective governing mechanisms. Therefore, understanding how
the interpretation of environmental sustainability is modifified
transnationally is increasingly important to local and global
governance of internationally traded seafood.
The recognition of regionally specifific perceptions of â€œbest
practiceâ€ and the resistance against the global monopoly
some international certifification schemes have over assessment
of sustainable practices and subsequent product labeling is
visible in the emergence of territorial certifification schemes
(Foley and Havice, 2016). Foley and Havice (2016) note
that for these schemes to be successful they must integrate
state regulation and interests of seafood producers with
international markets and governance norms and must
operate credibly within transnational commodity networks.
Interactions between the network of actors and their
governance frameworks also contributes to the perception
of environmentally sustainable seafood. When discussing
transnational activism, the globalization of markets is commonly
regarded as the trigger, however this fails to address the
â€œwhen,â€ â€œwhyâ€ and â€œhowâ€ by difffferent actors and their
networks conduct transnational activism (Tarrow, 2005).
Tarrow describes transnationalism as a set of international
networks, creating society-like structures, that allow individuals
to move effffortlessly between scales and spheres of inflfluence.
Adding to this, Beckâ€™s (1996) â€œglobal risk societyâ€ and
â€œcosmopolitismâ€ encompass world-wide communications
and global environmental risks, whereby political borders
are transcended boundaries. This risk â€œcan be dramatized or
minimized, transformed or simply denied according to the
norms that decide what is known and what is not.â€ (Beck, 2011:
1349). This is exemplifified by Lester (2014) describing where
an Australian Environmental Non-Government Organisation
(ENGO) launched a decade-long campaign persuading Japanese
corporations that Tasmanian forestry companies and products
were unsustainable. Simultaneously, direct action activism was
occurring at the site of forestry practices. However, the practices
of Tasmanian forestry companies only gained noticeable
attention when the obtaining of certifification became necessary
to secure international markets and contracts for forestry
production. Here the risk was avoided until certifification made
the issue inescapable.
The environmental sustainability of seafood is prevalent in
transnational market based governance discourses involving
governments, seafood harvesters and producers, ENGOs, media
actors, and consumers (Miller, 2014; Kate and Alice, 2018).
However, there are limited theoretical literature and empirical
case study examples to understand how environmental concerns
are conveyed transnationally in relation to the role of media and
environmental campaigning.
To explore how environmental concerns regarding seafood
production are carried transnationally in the context of local
production, international trade and global communications,
this paper draws on one of Australiaâ€™s topical environmental
conflflicts concerning seafood production: Fin-fifish aquaculture
in Tasmania. Marine coastal waters in Tasmania, Australiaâ€™s
southern island state, are used to farm Atlantic salmon
for domestic consumption and export to Asian markets.
However, the industry is facing considerable opposition from
local community groups, local and national ENGOs and
journalists. While local opposition remains, both domestic
and international demand for Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon
continues. Free trade agreements between Australia and Asian
countries including China, Japan and Korea are making
these export markets more accessible and are likely to
increase demand for farmed Atlantic salmon, and thereby

potentially increase the pressure on ecosystem services at
sites of production.
The aim of this paper is to gain an understanding of how the
potential or perceived environmental risks of seafood production
(particularly salmon aquaculture) are understood, articulated,
negotiated and potentially resolved across transnational media
and communication networks, particularly in the Australia-Asia
region. The growing Asian middle class is a signifificant inflfluencer
in food production and resource use globally. As we enter what an
Australian Government 2014 white paper refers to as the â€œAsian
Century,â€ Asia is, and is set to continue to be, an important
export market for Australia, with trade agreements being signed
(Tasmanian Government, 2013). To identify how the construct
of environmental sustainability of seafood flflows transnationally
the analysis identififies how environmental sustainability is defifined
and negotiated, who is involved and what mechanisms are used.
To do this we ask:
(1) What are the perceptions of environmentally sustainable
seafood production within an international community and
which actors portray these perceptions?
(2) How do these perceptions inflfluence local debates of
environmentally sustainable production of seafood?
(3) How do local issues inflfluence international discourse
regarding the environmental sustainability seafood?
Trade in the Australia-Asia Region; The
Importance of Seafood and Salmon
The Chinese seafood market (both production and consumption)
is the largest in the world. Chinese consumption patterns are
likely to have the strongest inflfluence on global fifish markets
into the future with the region expected to account for 38%
of the global consumption of seafood by 2030 (World Bank,
2014). These consumption patterns are highly relevant to global
environmental outcomes. The scale of this consumption and
the trend toward luxury species has been directly linked to
overfifishing and stock declines in some fifisheries (Fabinyi et al.,
2012; Cao et al., 2017). Rising demand for luxury seafood in
China has initiated a â€œglobal blue gold rushâ€ (Caplog Group and
EDF Maxico, 2014). For example, in 2014, accessing the growing
Chinese middle-class consumer became easier and cheaper
with the launch of â€œGfresh,â€ an online marketplace facilitating
the import of seafood to China, directly linking business and
consumer. In the companyâ€™s fifirst 2 years of operation it is
reported to have â€œprocessed more than $200 million worth of
wholesale live seafood ordersâ€ (Kolodny, 2017). The platform
notes origin, species, and quality of their catch.
In 2015 Australia signed free trade agreements with Japan
and China. Australiaâ€™s trade relations with its Asian neighbors
is a prominent agenda for governments and industries. At the
2016 G20 meeting the then Australian Prime Minister, Malcom
Turnbull, with reference to trade between China and Australia, is
reported as stating: â€œIt would be a mistake of historic proportions
for the G20 to stand by while scare campaigns not based on
facts or evidence foster protectionism, or indeed isolationism,â€
(ABC News, 2016). While this statement was made in reference
to Australia blocking agricultural and electricity sales to China,
this quote represented the trade atmosphere between China and
Australia and captures the Australian Governments sentiment
regarding strengthening trade relations with China. In other
words, G20 leaders should ignore economic scaremongering and
be aware of the risks of opposition campaigning against efffforts to
strengthen trade relations, particularly with Asia.
The transnational flflow of investment, resources and
information is expected to increase and congregate in
the Asian region. Lesterâ€™s (2014) research into Australiaâ€™s
White Paper on the trade of goods and services in the
Australia-Asia region, Australia in the Asian Century
(Commonwealth of Australia, 2012), suggests that:
if media and communications, community organizations and
individuals (among others) have crucial roles to play in developing
Australiaâ€™s â€œtwo-wayâ€ links with Asia, these may only rarely
present a â€œpublic diplomacyâ€ stance that promoted the Australian
government or business communityâ€™s immediate interests. Instead,
they will increasingly produce multi-directional and multi-layered
flflows of political communication and action in which distant
supports join with those affffected to resist development, end resource
procurement and undermine growth strategies. How Australian
government and industry choose to respond to and manage the
economic and political impact of these protests and the still
poorly understood transnational communities of environmental
concern that result will be a crucial test of Australian claims to
democratic and market leaderships among its regional neighbors in
the Asian Century.
The subsequent 2013 white paper â€œTasmaniaâ€™s place in the
Asian Centuryâ€ stipulated the opportunity for luxury export
items as the Asian middle class is predicted to grow in value
to three billion Australian dollars by 2030 and have the largest
population of high-income earners in the world within the next
20â€“30 years. From 2013 to 2017 Australian export increased
by 40% from $1 billion to $1.4 billion with exports to China
forming most of this growth (Fabinyi, 2007). This paper identififies
â€œenabling the expansion of salmon aquaculture in Macquarie
Harbor,â€ a large inlet on the west coast of Tasmania and the
fifirst area to farm salmon in Australia, as one of the key
activities to build export strengths and sustainable development
(Tasmanian Government, 2013: 43). However, this growth
agenda is challenged when the Institute for Marine and Antarctic
Studies (IMAS) is reported to have found salmon farming
to be responsible for â€œenvironmental collapseâ€ in Macquarie
Harbor (Woodruffff, 2017), highlighting the conflflict between the
growth and impact discourses. This tension is not expected to
diminish with seafood now being the fourth largest export for
Tasmania (Tasmanian Government, 2017), with international
trade reported to have increased by 27% in 2015, including a
doubling of sales to China.
Australia only made up 0.3% of Chinaâ€™s Atlantic salmon
imports in 2017, with 0.53% from 2008 to 2018. Meanwhile,
China made up 65% of Australiaâ€™s total sales in 2017, an
unusually high export year with 32% increase from 2008
to 2018 (FRDC, 2018). Additionally, there is a growing
discourse regarding Asian investment in Tasmanian salmon
companies, the strengthening vertical monopolies that are
forming and possible implications for future food security
(Thompson et al., 2011, MacDonald, 2018, Oâ€™Conner, 2018). In

Australian economy and the relative insignifificance of Australian
product for China, these fifigures make clear the vulnerabilities of
trade for Australia.
The link between Chinaâ€™s consumption patterns and impact
on global fifish stocks, combined with Asiaâ€™s contribution
to Australian trade, further highlights the importance of
investigating transnational flflows of environmental concern
(Fabinyi et al., 2017). With increased exports to China and
Chinese investment in the state, Tasmania provides a unique
and critical opportunity to explore what Lester (2014) describes
as â€œmulti-directional and multi layeredâ€ links with Asia and
â€œpoorly understood transnational communities of environmental
concernâ€ and the responses they elicit.
Local Conflflicts in Tasmania Concerning
Salmon Aquaculture
Salmon aquaculture in Tasmania has been a controversial
industry since its inception in the early 1990s and acts as a local
case study in this research. Three companies farm salmon in
Tasmania: Tassal, Huon Aquaculture, and Petuna. Tassal is the
largest of the three and Petuna the smallest. The act of farming
salmon in public marine waters has been contested between those
who hold environmentally centered ethics and those who support
industrial growth in otherwise struggling regional communities.
Since 2012 the industry has undergone expansion, and with
the support of the Tasmanian state government, announced
production would double by 2030 (Tasmanian Government,
2013). The proposed expansion into new unfarmed areas in
2016 was preceded by a decline in environmental health of
already farmed areas and a spate of regulatory attempts to
manage these impacts. This sparked public debate regarding
the adequacy of the governance mechanisms to manage the
environmental impacts of the salmon industry. Subsequently,
two critical discourse moments (Carvalho, 2005) occurred. In
2015 a Government led senate inquiry was held into the
â€œRegulation of fifin-fifish aquaculture in Tasmaniaâ€ where 103
public submissions were received followed by a 2-day hearing.
In 2016, local opposition groups were formed, environmental
campaigns became prevalent and increased media attention
took what was historically a locally contained conflflict to
audiences Australia wide with Four Corners, Australiaâ€™s premier
investigative journalism television program, airing an episode
titled â€œBig Fish.â€ This media attention has focused on how
the environmental risk of the industriesâ€™ expansion has been
managed. The complex social networks that formed around
these critical discourse moments are explored in previous work
(Cullen-Knox et al., 2019).
One of the main ways for producers to inform purchasers and
consumers that their practices are environmentally sustainable is
through third-party certifification (Hatanaka et al., 2005). In the
case of the Tasmanian salmon industry, third-party certifification,
in addition to government regulation, has played a key role in
the environmental governance of the industry. The Aquaculture
Stewardship Council (ASC) scheme is the most visible in this
case, with Tassal the fifirst salmon company in the world to
achieve ASC certifification across all its operations (Tassal, 2018).
Compared to local government regulations, the ASC scheme
and standards are global in outlook. It brings, or is claimed
to bring, sustainability standards based on scientifific advice
and management practices as applied in a range of countries
to the localized site of production. Other Tasmanian salmon
aquaculture companies hold third-party certifification by other
providers. However, the partnership between Tassal and ASC has
been the most visible and contentious in the Tasmanian public
discourse (Cullen-Knox et al., 2019).
Regardless of being ordered by the Environmental Protection
Authority (EPA) to destock leases and receiving non-compliance
notices, Tassal was perceived to retain ASC certifification.
However, Tassal opted to exclude these non-compliant leases
in the ASC audit and therefore forfeited ASC certifification for
these leases. The ambiguity regarding this process and the
uncertainty this created is present in the auditorâ€™s report (see
SCS Global Services, 2017). In response, Environment Tasmania,
a local ENGO, made claims that the ASC audit process, along
with WWF partnership, was faulty and corrupt. Environment
Tasmania initiated a petition â€œdemanding that all certififications
for Macquarie Harbor be suspended and a full and transparent
review of just how Tassal has retained ASC certifification while
breaching key ASC standards for more than 18 monthsâ€
(Environment Tasmania, 2016). Additionally, Environment
Tasmania, developed a â€œTasmanian Salmon Consumer Guideâ€
to rank Tasmanian salmon companies based on a traffiffiffic light
system. Criteria included salmon mortality rates, stocking density
and escapees, bird and seal interactions, antibiotic use, genetic
modifification, dissolved oxygen levels, site water temperature and
depth, capacity to flflush waste, impact on protected species and
areas and wild fifish use in feed (Environment Tasmania, 2019).
Simultaneously, Environment Tasmania commenced a campaign
against transnational ENGO WWF for partnering with Tassal
(see Cullen-Knox et al., 2019).
The diffiffifficulty of including local concerns in global governance
schemes was highlighted during a public engagement meeting
held by accredited third party auditors (Conformity Assessment
Body at SCS Global Services) evaluating the application of the
ASC standard in Hobart in 2017 regarding fifin fifish farming
in Macquarie Harbor. This public engagement formed part
of the ASC biannual audits for certifified salmon farming
sites. At the meeting concerns were raised in relation to the
environmental impacts of salmon farming, primarily by ENGOs.
For example Environment Tasmania, a Tasmanian ENGO, is
reported as stating â€œTassal did not deserve ASC certifification for
Macquarie Harbor, because it was failing to meet the councilâ€™s
own minimum oxygen level standardsâ€ (Burgess, 2017). The
auditors note in the 2017 report that there were concerns raised
(predominantly by ENGOs) during the community meeting that
the ASC standard was neither adequate nor applied correctly. The
auditors report notes Environmental Tasmaniaâ€™s concerns that
the auditors interpretation of non-conformities do not align with
the environmental impact at the site;
Breaches of ASC standards for DO levels were classifified as
â€œminorâ€ in the fifirst ASC surveillance report. At this time evidence
from Government data, the Dissolved Oxygen Working Group
and IMAS, indicated that DO levels had dropped to worrying
levels harbor wide.

Cullen-knox et al.
Tracing Environmental Sustainability Discourses
The evidence on DO indicated a systemic failure in the ecology of
the harbor such that it could not support farming to ASC standards.
Environment Tasmania argues that â€œnon-compliancesâ€ for the
companies breaches in DO standards should have been, and should
certainly now be, considered major non-conformities.
However, the report fifinds that the ASC standard was correctly
applied in the case of Tassalâ€™s Macquarie Harbor leases. Any non
conformities were correctly classifified and closed out according
the ASC methodology during surveillance audits (see SCS Global
Services, 2017). However, the report acknowledges that the ASC
standard is globally applicable and local conditions might require
a difffferent approach. The auditors state that the standard may
require changes, based on further scientifific monitoring and
potentially a change of monitoring methods, to address local
environmental impacts (SCS Global Services, 2017). This is seen
in the auditorsâ€™ response to a general concern raised at the
stakeholder meeting that â€œTassal has gotten too big too quickly.
It has only taken 3 years for the Franklin lease to completely kill
the seabed. It makes a mockery of ASC accreditation. How do we
know that the same thing wonâ€™t happen to the Middle harbor and
Gordon leases?â€(pp: 86):
The recent IMAS report has raised concerns that the compliance
monitoring is not adequate to support management and further
research has been proposed and additional recommendations were
made. Assessments against the ASC standards rely heavily on
published information and monitoring surveys rather than its own
additional surveys. Therefore, it cannot be judged in isolation. The
monitoring system that has been applied in Macquarie Harbor for
many years is now under question and will be strengthened. These
proposed research and additional monitoring requirement will be
included in any further assessment.
The ASC standards have been developed to be globally applicable
with international multi-stakeholder engagement over may years.
Local conditions may vary greatly from one site to another and,
in some cases, a difffferent approach might be necessary to deliver
more accurate assessments. Identifying these and feeding them into
the standard review process is important for the development of the
standard. The audit team has committed to do that and will provide
all standard specifific issues to the ASC for their consideration.
As it stands the audit team and past reports prepared by SCS
and members of the team have been reviewed by the offiffifficial
ASC accreditation body, ASI. The review confifirmed our proper
understanding and application of the standard. (SCS Global
Services, 2017: 86).
This exemplififies the complexities of addressing and
communicating the interaction between local and global
governance mechanisms and difffferences in what is considered
acceptable level of environmental impact.
Theory: Understanding the Interaction
Between Local and Global Discourse
Transnational communications, governance, knowledge,
investment and trade (among others) are pronounced inflfluences
in natural resource management. However, as Hutchins and
Lester (2015) state, investigating these complex aspects of media,
public and policy in local environmental governance in an
increasingly transnational world is challenging;
To study conflflict in this way and at this scale is no small
task, encompassing intricate networks of environmental concern,
strategic webs of media and political inflfluence, public policy debates,
and bi- and multi-lateral trade negotiations and deals. Nonetheless,
it is imperative that this research challenge is met, as this is the arena
in which global environmental futures are set to be determined.
The scholarship on global communication, policy and trade
emphasizes the role of the local in the global and the importance
of maintaining a sense of equality between the two scales
when fifirst examining a case. Terms such as â€œglocalisationâ€
encompassing how economic, political and social dynamics
occurring at the global scale inflfluence processes on the local
scale and vice versa (Ramutsindela, 2004) and indicate a keen
sense of the local in the global. Local threats and global risks
are amalgamated to play a role in the decision-making of each
(Lester, 2016). Similarly, ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ  (2015)state that
high-level regional and national policies should never discount
local community attitudes and interests because the local level is
the level of implementation. If local preferences and values are
disregarded, coupled with the growth of a sector (in this case the
expansion of fifin-fifish aquaculture), it becomes a recipe for disaster
according to ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ¡ and lessons from these
conflflicts should underpin the future management of this food
production sector. When national and international networks
or coalitions are formed, local and global conflflict discourses are
intertwined and subsequent arguments are the product of a glocal
process (Swyngedouw, 1997).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Collection
In order to explore information flflows concerning the Tasmanian
salmon industry and its context in the global operating
environment for seafood, environmental sustainability and
target markets, two phases of data collection were undertaken;
textual analysis of news media articles and semi-structured in
depth interviews. News articles were collected from the fifive
most prominent news sources in Australia. Three of these
were Tasmanian based newspapers the Hobart Mercury (111),
Launceston Examiner (38) and the Burnie Advocate (58), and
two were national news sources, the Australian (7) and ABC
News (63). News articles were collected using the Factiva news
database using the search terms: â€œsalmon farmâ€ OR â€œfifish farmâ€
OR â€œsalmon aquacultureâ€ OR Tassal OR â€œHuon Aquacultureâ€ OR
Petuna. News articles that did not address salmon farming in
Tasmania were excluded. For example, many articles published
fifinancial updates and share prices and other aquaculture pursuits
in Australia. News articles were collected for the 6 months
following the Senate Inquiry (15 July 2015 to 15 January 2016)
and Four Corners Program â€œBig Fishâ€ (1 May 2016 to 1 November
2017). Particular attention was paid to international references
being made and the context in which they were made.

Tracing Environmental Sustainability Discourses
To provide greater detail and the opportunity for validation
of strategies, mechanisms and claims based on transnational
flflows, interviews were conducted with 29 individuals. Interview
participants were considered to be key informants and were
selected based on their ability to represent local through to global
aspects of seafood sustainability and trade in the Australia-Asia
region (Table 1). Of these interviewees, 16 had experience in the
Tasmanian salmon aquaculture and/or Australia trade relations
with Asia, 8 operating in a global capacity regarding salmon
specififically, seafood more generally and/or global markets, and
5 were experts in Asian business and media. Interviewees were
not considered to represent the entire Australia-Asia conditions
for which environmental sustainability and seafood trade would
operate in. However, the broad cross section of inflfluential and
knowledgeable positions of interviewees did provide opportunity
for in-depth analysis of concepts and a source of triangulation or
verifification of results from the textual analysis.
The interviews covered topics of local transnational flflows of
information regarding seafood sustainability. Participants were
asked how they obtained and shared information, identifying
interactions and relationships between key stakeholder groups
both locally and transnationally. In doing so, specifific details
were gathered regarding the intervieweesâ€™ communications
practices and strategies. An overview was obtained regarding
how the interviewees portrayed their operating environment and
their understanding of environmental campaigning, media, and
environmental governance. In particular, the interviews explored
the processes of claims-making and decision-making processes
of ENGOs, seafood companies, government regulators, media,
environmental campaigning and the interactions this elicits

between these actor groups. The extent to which these either
draw upon or contribute to transnational messaging regarding
environmental impacts of seafood production was considered.
The implications of these networks and conflflict discourses for
environmental governance at the local and regional level was
then explored. Interviews were conducted by the fifirst author
from mid 2017 to early 2018, with one conducted by the second
author in 2016. The interviews were digitally recorded and
professionally transcribed.
Data Analysis
Critical discourse analysis of qualitative data (interviews
and news articles) was conducted by applying an inductive
qualitative coding technique using Nvivo 11 software (QSR
International). This software allows for descriptive coding to
identify and organize ideas, themes, and concepts. Prevalent
concepts were organized into hierarchal coding. Discourse
has been defifined as a â€œshared way of apprehending the
world...constructing meanings and relationship and helping
defifine common sense and legitimate knowledgeâ€ (Dryzek, 2013).
This critical discourse analysis identifified how difffferent actors
characterized the transnational elements of salmon aquaculture
and seafood globally, indicators that information was flflowing
transnationally and the mechanisms by which this was occurring,
and the outcomes these transnational dimensions had on
environmental governance. The analysis focused particularly on
the environmental sustainability of the industry.
Linking the two methods of qualitative coding and discourse
analysis follows Fleming et al. (2018), which coded key concepts
and language use at the sentence level. The analysis identifified
key themes present in the text (interviews and media content)
and organized into codes. These codes were constantly compared,
reviewed and redefifined as new concepts were identifified or
merged during analysis.
RESULTS
The analysis of interviews (Table 2) and news text (Table 3)
revealed how difffferent actors determined, and used information
to support this determination, whether the industry was or
was not meeting international environmental standards for
farming salmon. Not only was there a disconnect between
international standards and how they are expected to be applied
locally, but also how difffferent markets interpret environmental
sustainability and what that might mean for local operations.
Third-party certifification was used by industry as a benchmark
for environmentally sustainable practices and as a means of
managing the risk of environmental campaigning. However,
discrepancies in what is considered acceptable environmental
impact between local ENGOs and certifification schemes were
observed in the research.
Asia, particularly China, is a growing market for Tasmanian
farmed salmon. Australian branding and certifification indicate
to the Chinese consumer that the food is safe, rather than
environmentally sustainable. This indicates a gap between local
debates at the site of production in Tasmania and the values of

for media and ENGOs in China is also considered more
restricted than that of Australia. Nonetheless, Chinese ENGOs
were observed to be campaigning against selling of Australian
product. It was also understood that ENGOs are profificient at
facilitating transnational networks and discourse while industry
is still gaining momentum at the global level. Industry considered
some ENGOs to be a source of support at the global level of
discourse regarding environmental sustainability.
Transnational Relationships Between
and Among ENGOs and Supply Chain
Actors
The results of the interviews indicated a shift in the relationship
between ENGOs and international seafood supply chain actors.
Interviewees operating in a transnational capacity in industry,
ENGOs, media, retail and certifification reported that the degree of
collaboration currently observed in relationships between some
ENGOs and seafood businesses is vastly difffferent to the mostly
hostile relationships between business or industry and NGOs
historically. As one interviewee noted, now â€œwe act together,
we discuss problems, the NGOs start to understand what is
our problem and we start to listen to their problemsâ€ (Asia
based interviewee 25). Similarly, transnational Interviewee 17
highlighted that;
Campaigns against salmon farming have shifted from making kind
of global unbacked claims to being very well documented claims.
However, it was also acknowledged in the interviews
that historically, environmental claims regarding unacceptable
environmental impact of harvesting or producing seafood,
highlighted in transnational campaigns by global ENGOs, were
not always being challenged by the seafood industry with the
same effiffifficacy at the global level as ENGO campaigns:
The way (the industry) was segmented nationally, internationally
or transnationally, was very peculiar in that there was not always
a voice that could address the concerns that were being made on a
global scale (Transnational interviewee 17).
Further highlighting the global scale of environmental
discourse, industry representatives noted that ENGOs have
been putting pressure on them to be responsible for their entire
value chain, emphasizing the necessity for global environmental

Tasmanian salmon industry is world class
Certifification
Provides clear standards for industry to achieve
Provides a way for industry to show their practices
are environmentally sustainable, safe and ethical
standards and transnational networking mechanisms that

transnational interviewee 19 addressed the presence of alternate
opinions between and among stakeholder groups regarding how
to best improve or meet environmentally sustainable practices
through the value chain. Namely whether it is most effffective to be
an active participant in a supply chain that could have practices
that are considered unsustainable to help improve it or simply to
not use those products.
The interviews indicated that managing the commercial risk
of environmental campaigning has been one important driver
over the past two decades for the global seafood industry to
accept and embrace the concept of environmental sustainability.
A representative of a prominent Asian retailer identifified in
interview that the company determined procurement risk areas
by using ENGOs, media content and customer surveys as the
major sources of information. The interviewee particularly noted
that the retailer did not address scientifific information in this
decision-making process. If during this monitoring process
conflflict was identifified to be present regarding a product they
stock, the retailer would send someone from headquarters to
local suppliers in an attempt to solve the problem (Asia-based
interviewee 25). This interviewee also noted that in response
to ENGOs asking retailers to initiate environmental discourse
through the supply chain, seminar-type events were set up to
instigate information sharing with key stakeholders, such as
government, companies and ENGOs in the supplying country.
When asked why these retailers work closely with ENGOs
the interviewees noted three key reasons; (1) to understand
the ideas and thinking of the ENGOs in order to manage
the risk of environmental campaigning, (2) to utilize the
ENGOs expertise and international networks and, (3) ENGOs
provide technical expertise on matters that span international
governance boundaries.
A comparable example provided by interviewees was that of
Southern Bluefifin Tuna, which was produced in Australia and sold
in the Asian market with third party environmental certifification.
In 2017, a major e-commerce platform in Asia, JD.com, posted
a photo on social media of a Southern Bluefifin Tuna promoting
the Australian supplier. In response, a group of Chinese ENGOs
campaigned in the Chinese media for JD.com to stop selling the
fifish based on its International Union for Conversation of Nature
(IUCN) critically endangered status. Even though this fifish holds
the â€œFriends of the Seaâ€ certifification, JD.com ceased selling the
tuna within 3 days of the campaign. WWF was also criticized
for their partnership with JD.com. Similar to the Tasmanian
salmon debate, dialogue between the ENGO and industry was
reported to have been limited at best, with all communications
occurring via media platforms (Asia-based interviewee 27).
While Friends of the Sea serves as a difffferent certifification process
to ASC, they both advocate for environmentally sustainable
seafood and portray this sentiment to consumers. This example
reinforces the fifinding that communication between local and
international actors was absent and certifification did not, in this
instance, provide protection against criticism regarding seafood
production practices. This example encompassed a similar set
of actors to the salmon case study, but directly operating
across the Australia-Asia region (Asian-based and international
ENGOs, Australian seafood producers and exporters, global
environmental certifification schemes, and Chinese media). These
actors also appear to disagree about was the acceptable
environmental impact of seafood production activities, providing
a precedent for conflflict between ENGOs and certifification
schemes to occur in the trade of seafood from Australia
into Asia markets.
The Extent to Which Global Discourses
Are Used in Local Claims-Making
Local industry and government actors have used global
references in the Tasmanian newspapers by promoting third
party certifification of the industry and the implementation of what
they claimed to be â€œworld classâ€ environmental practices and
standards (Rockcliffff, 2017). As a rebuttal, local ENGOs promoted
international scientifific literature and details of international fifin-
fifish farming practices to assess nuances of the meaning of â€œworld
classâ€ standards. For example, it was claimed in the Hobart
Mercury:
If you look around the world, it is clear that the future for
aquaculture is either land based or properly offffshore. . . Other
salmon farming countries like Norway and Canada have arrived
at the same conclusion (Wood, 2017).
Additionally, the ramififications that local industry
practices can have on distant environments and societies
was acknowledged in the interviews. For example, if a local
company shuts down, retailers must then source the product
from elsewhere in the world that may have lower standards or
regulatory rigor. Those in support of the industry explained:
If our salmon industry goes by the wayside, the gap will be fifilled,
and the jobs will be taken, by producers in Asia or South America
(Walton, 2017).
These potentially undesirable repercussion of extremist approaches
on industry and the environment has meant that â€œwe need to
be really really careful that we do things very very well hereâ€
(Tasmania-based interviewee 8).
Using international materials to underpin local claims is
instilling the notion of a â€œtransnational community of concernâ€
(Lester, 2014), giving grass-roots groups a form of legitimacy.

claims. However, the results also indicate there was little
connection between local and international perceptions of the
Tasmanian salmon industry. For instance, it was perceived among
portions of the Tasmanian public that industry and government
processes lacked transparency, particularly those associated
with Tassal (Whitson, 2017). However, a Tasmanian newspaper
highlighted that internationally Tassal had been applauded for
its transparency:
TASMANIAN salmon producer Tassal Limited has achieved
another sustainability honor, this time on the world stage. ASX
listed Tassal was named as the worldâ€™s top seafood company for
sustainability reporting and transparency in a report rating the top
100 seafood companies on various measures (Ford, 2015).
Tasmanian-based interviewee 9 also highlighted that while
Tassal focused on undertaking initiatives of environmental
sustainability and transparency that were recognized
internationally, namely ASC certifification, the company had
overlooked the need to engage and promote these initiatives
locally early on in their expansion.
The disconnect between local environmental campaigning
and global certifification schemes regarding the perception
of the processes and implementation of certifification has
created confusion for industry concerning what is deemed
â€œgood enough. . .what is sustainable, what does sustainability
mean?â€ (Tasmania-based interviewee 8) and what mechanisms
to determine and practice environmental sustainability are
considered legitimate to both the consumer, ENGOs and third
party certififiers. This highlights disagreement and conflflict over
interpretation of fact (e.g., whether something is transparent),
which can be based on difffferent sources of information, values
and priorities driving how that information is perceived.
Certifification as a Mechanism of
Transnational Flow of Information
Regarding Environmental Sustainability
of Seafood Production
Seafood buyers acknowledged certifification schemes were useful
tools to help identify seafood that is more likely to align with
their purchasing policies (Asia-based interviewee 25). However,
a range of interviewees highlighted that global third-party
certifification schemes for environmental sustainability were still
undergoing improvements and identifified that the relationship
between environmental certifification and environmental
sustainability was strained. One transnational interviewee (18)
depicted some of the challenges by explaining â€œnot everything
that is certifified is by defifinition sustainable, but defifinitely
not everything that is sustainable is certifified.â€ This provides
considerable challenges for those either wishing to produce or
purchase environmentally sustainable seafood and to show that
they are doing so.
Defifining environmentally sustainable practices and how best
to assess them can vary between and within stakeholder groups.
For example, consumers in difffferent countries â€œhave difffferent
concepts of what sustainability means and difffferent levels of
urgency to address those issuesâ€ (Transnational interviewee 19).
At the site of salmon production in Tasmania local actors
defifined environmental sustainability by its impact on the
immediate environment (e.g., benthic and water quality, fauna
and flflora and asthetics). However, for the Chinese consumer, any
indication of environmental certifification is used as a proxy for
provenance. Provence indirectly implies food safety or freshness.
Here, this is not a difffferent interpretation of sustainability
but rather indicates that these customers value the supply
chain traceability associated with the certifification label over
sustainability. Furthermore, ENGOs and those involved in third
party certifification had only just started to engage in matters of
environmental sustainability with the Chinese seafood supply
chain (Transnational interviewees 17 and 19). As China shifts
to a net importer, rather than certifying Chinese products,
certifification bodies and ENGO efffforts were said to be focusing
on raising awareness of sustainable purchasing practices in China
(Transnational interviewee 16). Additionally, Chinese media and
politics was said to be considerably complex to navigate (Asia
based interviewee 29). For example, in order to gain access
to moderated countries such as China the larger transnational
ENGOs (e.g., WWF and Greenpeace) are said to act as more of
a consultant to government, rather than activist organizations
(Asia-based interviewee 29). A speaker at the 2018 Asian Seafood
Expo explained that the environmental sustainability of a seafood
product only becomes an area of concern or discourse theme in
markets more established than those in China (fifield notes, Asian
Seafood Expo 2018).
DISCUSSION
Closing and Widening the Gap Between
Local and Global Perceptions of
Environmental â€œBest Practiceâ€
Global perceptions of â€œworldâ€™s best practiceâ€ were employed
in local discourse to support opposing agendas. Actors used
references to global standards to either endorse or discredit local
actions. This strategy either closed the gap between the local
and global or distanced the two. Both strategies were employed
to serve the same purpose of measuring local environmental
risk of salmon aquaculture. In an attempt to close the gap, the
Tasmanian government and industry actors initiated claims of
â€œworldâ€™s best practiceâ€ and promoted third-party certifification as
assurances that local-level environmental risks are sustainably
managed. Meanwhile, opposition groups promoted scientifific and
news material from other countries that farm salmon to support
assertions of environmental risk in Tasmania. Here ENGOs
are leveraging the notion of a â€œtransnational community of
concernâ€ (Lester, 2014) to legitimize their claims. This strategy
aligns with Olsen and Osmundsenâ€™s (2017) media analysis of
salmon aquaculture in Norway, which fifinds that connection
made with global discourse can have a greater inflfluence on
the perceptions of the environmental risks of aquaculture
compared to local experiences. Alternatively, local ENGOs also
created a gap between local and global standards to portray
a perceived mismanagement at the local level and attacked

Tracing Environmental Sustainability Discourses
the ASC for being corrupt. Here the ASC standard might
well be considered adequate as certifification but inadequate in
its application. What is also not considered in this use of
international references in the Tasmanian case is that difffferent
growing regions experience difffferent social and environmental
challenges (Vince and Haward, 2017).
The disconnect between local and international
interpretations of â€œbest practiceâ€ was initially only evident
through piecing together discourse in news media articles.
However, the gap between local and international interpretations
and applications of environmental â€œbest practiceâ€ was later made
obvious when local ENGO, Environment Tasmania, campaigned
against the transnational ENGO WWF and the ASC and their
partnership and certifification of Tassal (Environment Tasmania,
2017). Given the national and international credibility the WWF
and ASC symbol holds and the market capacity this has to
promote the idea of sustainability and associated practices, it
becomes a question of what is considered legitimate application
of environmentally sustainable standards to difffferent actors in
difffferent world regions. Environment Tasmania also collaborated
with the transnational ENGO Marine Stewardship Council to
develop a sustainable salmon consumer guide. Seafood guides
have been a long-standing tool used by ENGOs to promote
their perceptions of environmentally sustainable practices to
consumers. However, these have also highlighted the lack of
consensus among ENGOs and between ENGOs and industry
when defifining sustainable seafood (Roheim, 2009). Additionally,
third-party certifification schemes have been criticized for favoring
large-scale fifisheries in the developed world. This highlights that
while balancing local and global communications is challenging,
it is important to ensure one is not considered without the other,
especially when supply chains of both product and information
have local and global dimensions (Olson et al., 2014). This
case shows that variation in environmental â€œbest practiceâ€
perceptions underpin stakeholder conflflicts at both local and
international levels.
Third-Party Certifification as a Tool to Communicate
â€œBest Practiceâ€
Third party certifification of a product does not guarantee
local acceptance of a practice, nor should it form the only
mechanism by which a company demonstrates or defifines â€œbest
practice.â€ This aligns with ErtÃ¶r and Ortega-CerdÃ  (2015),
who argued that local interests and concerns should never
be discounted in global communications and governance.
While Tassal focused on achieving international standards in
environmental sustainability and reporting (ASC certifification),
the company is said to have lacked local stakeholder engagement
at the site of production. Local opposition groups voiced
concerns regarding the perceived lack of transparency of the
Tasmanian salmon industry, particularly Tassal. Meanwhile, the
salmon company received international praise for transparency
regarding its sustainability reporting. Interviewees reported that
the company was potentially too complacent in its expectation
that their commitment to achieving international environmental
and reporting standards would fifilter through and be accepted,
to local communities. This is perceived to have contributed
to the opposition from a portion of concerned communities
in Tasmania and a disconnect between these groups and
international standard-setting stakeholders and actors.
This work brings to the forefront the importance, and
at times diffiffifficulty, of acknowledging and attempting to
reconcile between local and international standards regarding
acceptable environmental risk. Aligning local expectations
and interpretations of environmental impact (identifified by
environmental campaigning) and global standards (e.g., ACS
certifification) is complex and the processes poorly communicated.
Local ENGOs claim that global standards do not fifit the
local reality. This work also highlights that claims of â€œworldâ€™s
best practiceâ€ and global governance mechanisms regarding
environmental sustainability are not as easily accepted where
transnational flflows of information regarding environmental
practices and environmental concerns are relatively effffortless,
frequent and available. This then highlights the role of ENGOs
in the selection and distribution of that information, given
their transnational networks. Equally, this analysis highlights the
capacity for these transnational flflows to transfer information to
sites of local production and inflfluence discourse on the basis of
transnational claims that do not reflflect or are irrelevant to the
sustainability issues at hand.
Environmental Campaigning and Media
Forces in Defifining Acceptable Practices
in the Australia-Asia Region
The degree of contestation of the environmental sustainability
status and credentials of seafood, and international variations of
what is considered acceptable environmental impact, may explain
why the strategies of ENGOs operating in the transnational
space are shifting. Rather than ENGOs solely being institutions
for protest and campaigning, actors throughout the supply
chain perceived some ENGOs as sources of expertise and
insight. They provide expertise in not only how to produce
and purchase environmentally sustainable products but also in
how to inflfluence the international social networks involved in
sustainability. ENGOs are also seen to be utilizing processes
whereby they create environmental discourse through the supply
chain by using the resources of large retail companies to
send messages transnationally, easily targeting key decision
makers within the supply chain. Nonetheless, in a key export
market for Australian seafood such as China, media coverage
can be a powerful driver when it affffects buyersâ€™ choices.
This study suggests that rather than local conflflicts from
the site of production transferring to international markets,
it is more likely for Chinese media and ENGOs to create
pressure on imported product. While some ENGOs and
journalists can create pressure for change these actors express
the diffiffifficulty of operating in China. The interviews identifified
the apparent lack of ENGO presence in Asian countries,
particularly in the capacity for which they are known in most
western countries.
While China is the major export market for Australian
farmed salmon it is also a country that interviewees who
work transnationally on seafood sustainability know little about.

Tracing Environmental Sustainability Discourses
Only in recent years have these actors begun to engage in
issues of environmental sustainability within China. This aligns
with Fabinyi (2016) who states Asian consumers are said to
have less exposure and/or desire to address environmental
concerns in their purchasing practices. Therefore if unsustainable
environmental harm is (not just perceived to be) occurring
at the site of production, exports to Asian markets continue
to grow as predicted (Linehan et al., 2013) and Asian
consumer preferences do not send signals through markets for
environmentally sustainable product, then other non-market
mechanisms, such as protest campaigns and regulatory rigor,
could have a greater role to play at the site of production or
extraction to ensure environmental sustainable standards are
met. The interviewees also discussed the implications for global
net environmental impact of seafood production, because of the
ease of product substitution. This highlights the responsibility of
ENGOs running environmental campaigns to consider possible
unintended consequences - for example, exploitation of less
managed fifisheries close to markets to meet food security needs
if imported product is halted.
CONCLUSION
This paper has explored the transnational flflow of information,
resources, perceptions and governance of environmentally
sustainable seafood. Tasmanian salmon aquaculture provided
a local context from which the research could expand. By
traversing local and global scales, this research contributed
to understanding the mechanisms for which information
regarding the environmental risk of seafood production flflows
transnationally. In doing so it also identifified some of the risks
of not addressing both local and global factors in communication
and governance strategies.
Contributing to the diffiffifficulty of communicating
environmental sustainability is the apparent lack of shared
understanding concerning what constitutes environmentally
sustainable practices and how to govern this in an increasingly
transnational operating environment. Local and international
perceptions and expectations regarding the sustainability
requirements of salmon companies did not align in the case of
the Tasmanian salmon industry. The interpretation and meaning
of environmentally sustainable seafood production shifts as it
moves from the site of production through the supply chain
to export markets. These difffferences in the interpretations of
environmental sustainability underpin stakeholder conflflicts at
both local and international levels. The challenge for all actors
is to ensure communications and management practices and
strategies address concerns at the local level while operating
within global governance, market and resource pressures.
