Unpacking Environmental Conflict: Why It Matters and How We Can Move Forward

Environmental conflict is not just about opposing views on resource use—it reflects the deeper tensions between science, policy, values, and power. Whether it’s debates about marine aquaculture, forest clearing, or renewable energy siting, these issues are often shaped as much by how they are communicated and contested in public as they are by technical assessments and environmental data.

Understanding Environmental Conflict

At the heart of environmental conflict is a struggle over meaning: who defines the problem, who is responsible, who should act, and how?

Your PhD work explored this through the lens of mediatised environmental conflict (Hutchins & Lester, 2015), a theory that explains how conflicts are constructed and fought out in the media and public discourse. Building on Simon Cottle’s ‘mediatised conflict’, it acknowledges that the media isn’t just a passive channel for information—it’s an active arena where science, values, and politics collide.

In this space, actors such as journalists, activists, industry, politicians, and increasingly scientists, compete to define what counts as environmental risk, what’s acceptable, and what action should follow.

Why Environmental Conflict Is Important

These conflicts influence the future of our ecosystems and communities. They are not just symbolic—they shape laws, industry practices, public trust, and livelihoods.

Importantly, conflict can be productive. It can push governments to act, spotlight environmental risks, and give voice to underrepresented groups. But when poorly managed, it becomes unproductive—amplifying mistrust, distorting facts, and stalling necessary change.

The Challenges

What makes environmental conflict so difficult to resolve?
	•	Power Imbalances: Not all voices are heard equally. Media can amplify or silence perspectives.
	•	Scientific Uncertainty: Science is crucial but often politicised, misunderstood, or contested.
	•	Complex Governance: Many actors, multiple jurisdictions, and unclear accountability.
	•	Misinformation: Polarised media environments and social media amplify emotion and erode trust.
	•	Transnational Influence: Local decisions are often shaped by global markets, supply chains, and campaigns.

So What Can Be Done?

Solving environmental conflict isn’t about finding “the truth”—it’s about making room for different knowledges, values, and interests to co-exist and be negotiated fairly.

Here are five steps toward more constructive environmental conflict management:

1. Improve Transparency

Make decision-making processes, data, and trade-offs visible and understandable. Uncertainty is inevitable—opacity is optional.

2. Bridge the Science–Society Gap

Recognise that science is essential but not neutral. Scientists need to engage as communicators, not just data providers.

3. Design Inclusive Processes

Involve stakeholders early and meaningfully, especially those most affected. Participation must go beyond tokenism.

4. Tackle Misinformation

Actively monitor public narratives. Use clear, accessible communication strategies that respond to public concerns, not just push facts.

5. Create Space for Dialogue

Conflict can’t be eliminated—but it can be made more constructive. Forums that allow different values and worldviews to be aired are key.

Environmental conflict is complex—but not unsolvable. With thoughtful communication, evidence-based processes, and inclusive governance, it’s possible to shift from vicious cycles of blame and mistrust toward virtuous cycles of collaboration and learning.
