## BIOGRAPHY SECTION
- Heading: Background
- Text: I'm an environmental sociologist with over a decade of experience working across government, research, industry, NGOs, and consultancies. My work sits at the intersection of people and the environment—managing natural resources, shaping policy, guiding governance, and supporting decision-making that's both evidence-based and grounded in real-world context.

With a background in both environmental and social sciences, I bring a big-picture understanding of how people and ecosystems interact. I’m especially drawn to the complex governance challenges around common-pool natural resources—where collaboration, transparency, and adaptive thinking really matter.

Over the years, I've contributed to projects ranging from integrated marine management, protected area governance, science communication, terrestrial and marine development and infrastrucutre, and seafood governance. I'm a certified IAP2 practitioner and hold a PhD in environmental conflict communication, which underpins my approach to stakeholder engagement and qualitative research.

What drives me is helping to bridge diverse perspectives—whether through surveys, interviews, or translating complex information into clear insights. I specialise in designing and delivering engagement and review processes that inform practical, inclusive, and context-relevant decisions.
