## BIOGRAPHY SECTION
- Heading: My Journey
- Text: I'm an environmental sociologist with over a decade of experience working across government, research, industry, NGOs, and consultancies. My work has always sat at the intersection of people and the environment—managing natural resources, shaping policy, guiding governance, and supporting decision-making that's both evidence-based and grounded in real-world context.

With a background in both environmental and social sciences, I bring a big-picture understanding of how people and ecosystems interact. I'm especially drawn to the complex governance challenges around common-pool natural resources—where collaboration, transparency, and adaptive thinking really matter.

Over the years, I've contributed to projects ranging from marine management and protected area governance to science communication, coastal development, and seafood sustainability. I'm a certified IAP2 practitioner and hold a PhD in environmental conflict communication, which underpins my approach to stakeholder engagement and qualitative research.

What drives me is helping to bridge diverse perspectives—whether through surveys, interviews, or translating complex information into clear insights. I specialise in designing and delivering engagement and review processes that inform practical, inclusive, and context-relevant decisions.

With expertise in marine conservation and environmental governance, I work to facilitate meaningful dialogue between researchers, policymakers, and communities to drive sustainable environmental solutions.
