## BIOGRAPHY SECTION
- Heading: Background
- Text: Hi, Iâ€™m Dr. Coco Cullen-Knox â€” an environmental sociologist, applied researcher, and consultant working to make conservation and natural resource management collaborative, inclusive, and effective. I focus on supporting meaningful stakeholder engagement and adaptive governance that works in practice, not just on paper.

 I started my career in environmental science, driven by a love of the natural world and a deep curiosity about how it works. Over time, I realised that while environmental  science can tell us whatâ€™s happening in our environment, lasting change depends on people, politics, and the way decisions are made.

That realisation led me to shift my focus and eventually pursue a PhD exploring how environmental risks are negotiated publicly, how society makes decisions about the environment, especially when those decisions are contested, emotional, or political.

Iâ€™ve worked across government, consultancies, NGOs, and research institutionsâ€”often at the messy intersection of science, policy, media, and community. What Iâ€™ve learned is this:

ðŸŒ± Ecological knowledge is only part of the puzzle. Effective management also requires insight into human behaviour, social dynamics, and the systems that shape our decisions.
ðŸŒ± People bring different values, histories, and stakes to the table â€” and that diversity needs to be heard, not managed away.
ðŸŒ± The questions we ask and how we ask them shapes the answers we get â€” thoughtful design matters.

So now, I help make environmental decision-making more inclusive and better equipped to handle real-world challenges.
