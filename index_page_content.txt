## BACKGROUND SECTION
- Heading: Background
- Heading Style: Underline
- Text: I'm an environmental sociologist with over a decade of experience working across government, research, industry, NGOs, and consultancies. My work sits at the intersection of people and the environment—managing natural resources, shaping policy, guiding governance, and supporting decision-making that's grounded in real-world context.
   With a background in both environmental and social sciences, I bring a big-picture understanding of how people and ecosystems interact. I'm especially drawn to the complex governance challenges around common-pool natural resources—where collaboration and adaptive thinking really matter.
   Over the years, I've contributed to projects ranging from integrated marine management, protected area governance, science communication, terrestrial and marine development and infrastructure, and seafood and fisheries governance. I'm a certified IAP2 practitioner and hold a PhD in environmental risk communication, which underpins my approach to stakeholder engagement and qualitative research.
   What drives me is helping to bridge diverse perspectives and translating complex information into clear insights. I specialise in designing and delivering engagement and review processes that help organisations cut through the noise, connect the dots, and make practical, inclusive, and forward-thinking decisions.
