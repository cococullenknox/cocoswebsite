## FOOTER
- Acknowledgment: I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which I live and work, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present. I recognise the deep and ongoing connection that First Nations peoples have to Country—land, waters, skies, and culture—and acknowledge their enduring knowledge systems and custodianship. I am committed to listening, learning, and working in ways that support self-determination and respectful collaboration.
